Additional Financing. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2, if the Company determines to solicit additional equity financing subsequent to exercise of the Option but prior to Commencement of Production (hereinafter defined) at the El Aguila project, it shall provide written notice to that effect to HOC and HOC shall be entitled to exclusively provide such financing upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. For purposes of the preceding sentence, \"Commencement of Production\" shall be defined as the production and delivery to the point of sale (refiner) by the Company (either directly or through a subsidiary) of not less than 4,000 ounces of gold within a 45 day period.

If HOC does not provide HOC JV Acceptance Notice to the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days or such shorter period as may be specified in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, of receiving of the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, the Company may enter into negotiations with any other person regarding the Proposed Joint Venture. If the Company truncates the period during which the HOC JV Acceptance Notice is required to be returned by HOC, it shall include in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice a statement certified by an officer of the Company that the Company has determined that it is necessary to truncate such period to avoid losing the opportunity to make such acquisition or other related transaction and that it has used commercially reasonable efforts to avoid truncating such period.\n\nARTICLE 7  STANDSTILL\n\nThe provisions of this Article 7 shall apply if HOC acquires the Additional Shares and for a period of two (2) years after the Subsequent Closing Date:\n\n7.1 Standstill\n\n  (a) HOC covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, HOC will not, and will not allow any HOC Entities to, in either case, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly:\n\n  (i) acquire or enter into any agreement to acquire or make any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner any equity securities of the Company (whether issued or unissued) that would result in a Pro Rata Interest greater than 40% other than (A) as a result of a stock dividend or distribution made by or a recapitalization of the Company, (B) in accordance with the terms of any dividend reinvestment or share purchase plan made available from time to time by the Company to holders of equity securities;

The Company shall pay all expenses associated with the registration, including filing and printing fees, counsel and accounting fees and expenses, and State \"Blue Sky\" fees and expenses. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify HOC by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within three (3) business days, after the Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide HOC with copies of any related prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby.\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n  (f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless HOC against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which it may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other public filing by the Company, so long as such statement has not been provided to the Company by HOC for inclusion in such registration statement; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, so long as such omission or alleged omission does not relate to HOC or the manner of sale for the Shares as provided to the Company by HOC; or (iii) any violation of the 1933 Act, any rule or regulation thereunder or any other securities law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to the action or inaction required of the Company in connection therewith.
