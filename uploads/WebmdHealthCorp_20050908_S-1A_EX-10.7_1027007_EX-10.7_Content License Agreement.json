The receiving party will, at the request of the disclosing party, during the term of this Agreement or thereafter (i) promptly return all Confidential Information and Trade Secrets held or used by the receiving party in whatever form, or (ii) at the discretion of the disclosing party, promptly destroy all such Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, including all copies thereof, and those portions of all documents that incorporate such Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets.\n\n7.

No waiver by either party hereto of any breach or default by the other party shall be construed to be a waiver of any other breach or default by such other party. Resort to any remedies referred to herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights and remedies to which either party is entitled under this Agreement or otherwise nor shall an election to terminate be deemed an election of remedies or a waiver of any claim for damages or otherwise.\n\n(f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed original, but all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n(g) Complete Agreement. This Agreement, including the attached Exhibits, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior understandings, whether oral or written, have been merged herein and are superseded hereby.
