Should On2 find that any Deliverable does not substantially conform to the relevant Specification, On2 shall promptly so notify Wildform in writing, which notice shall provide sufficiently detailed\n\n\n\n\n\nexplanation of the non-conformities so as to allow Wildform to reproduce them (any such notice is referred to herein as a \"Nonconformance Notice\"). Each of the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted by On2 unless On2 delivers to Wildform a Nonconformance Notice within thirty (30) business days of the delivery of such Deliverable. In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by On2 when either (i) On2 notifies Wildform in writing of its acceptance of such Deliverables or (ii) On2 does not deliver a Nonconformance Notice to Wildform within the Acceptance Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable.\n\n      3.2 Program Errors.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the payment provided for in this Article IV is not intended to constitute consideration for the Purchased Assets and Licensed Assets, payment for the license of which is provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n                                 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n      5.1 Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party represents and warrants to the Disclosing Party that:\n\n            5.1.1 it will keep and maintain all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure;\n\n            5.1.2 it will not, directly or indirectly, disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the Disclosing Party's prior written consent;\n\n            5.1.3 it will not make use of any Confidential Information for its own purposes, such as creation of a competitive product; or for the benefit of anyone or any entity other than as contemplated by this Agreement;\n\n            5.1.4 upon the Disclosing Party's written request, at the earlier of the end of the Term, or receipt of notice from the Disclosing Party of a breach by it of this Agreement or an Annex, the Receiving Party will deliver promptly to the Disclosing Party or, at the Receiving Party's option, will destroy all memoranda, notes, records, reports, media and other documents and materials (and all copies thereof) regarding or including any Confidential Information which the Receiving Party may then possess or have under its control; and\n\n            5.1.5 it will take no action with respect to the Confidential Information that is inconsistent with its confidential and proprietary nature.\n\n      5.2 Exceptions to Non-Disclosure Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement.\n\n      5.3 Receiving Party's Duty of Care. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                                   WARRANTIES\n\n      6.1 On2 Warranties. On2 makes the following representations and warranties to Wildform.\n\n      (a)   Authorization; Power and Authority.

Wildform (i) is a corporation             duly organized under the laws of the State of California, (ii) has             the requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into             and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) to the             best of Wildform's knowledge as of the Effective Date, the             Deliverables marked as Deliverable #2 will not infringe any             Intellectual Property Rights held by any third party.\n\n      (b)   Investment Representation.

Wildform represents and warrants to the Buyer that such Wildform is             acquiring the Payment Shares for investment purposes and not with a             view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof or             with any present intention of selling the Payment Shares in             connection with a distribution.

Wildform acknowledges that an             investment in the Payment Shares represents a high degree of risk\n\n            and that there is no assurance that Buyer's business or operations             will be successful. Wildform has considered carefully the risks             attendant to an investment in the Payment Shares and acknowledges             that, as a consequence of such risks, such Wildform could lose its             entire investment in the Payment Shares. Wildform acknowledges that,             at a reasonable time prior to the Effective Date, Buyer furnished to             it the information specified in paragraph (b)2(ii)(A) or (B) of, and             in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)             of, Rule 502 promulgated under Exchange Act.\n\n      (c)   Restricted Securities. Wildform understands that the Payment Shares             will be \"restricted securities\" under applicable federal securities             laws and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission             promulgated thereunder. Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available. Wildform further understands that, except as provided in             the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Buyer has no             obligation to register the sale of the Payment Shares or take any             other action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Act. Wildform             further understands that applicable state securities laws may impose             additional constraints upon the sale of securities\n\n      6.3 No Warranty.

All Incorporated Technology Works shall belong exclusively to On2, which shall have the right to obtain and to hold in its own name, copyrights, registrations, patents, or such other protection as may be appropriate to the subject matter, and any extensions and renewals thereof.
