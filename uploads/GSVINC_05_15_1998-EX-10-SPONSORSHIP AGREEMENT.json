THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR             DAMAGES OR ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR             ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE             AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY CLIENT TO EXCITE HEREUNDER.\n\n15.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n      a)    The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'             obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names,             confidentiality and/or User Data would result in irreparable injury             for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the             event of any breach or threatened breach of a party's obligations             regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names or             confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be entitled to seek             equitable relief in addition to its other available legal remedies             in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n      b)    In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or             concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other             than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks             or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, the parties will             first attempt to resolve the dispute(s) through good faith             negotiation. In the event that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved             through good faith negotiation, the parties will refer the             dispute(s) to a mutually acceptable mediator.\n\n      c)    In the event that disputes between the parties arising from or             concerning in any manner the subject matter of this Agreement, other             than disputes arising from or concerning trademarks, service marks             or trade names, confidentiality and/or User Data, cannot be resolved             through good faith negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer             the dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for             resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator\n\n                                       15\n\n                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL\n\n            pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules applicable             to commercial disputes.\n\n16.   GENERAL\n\n      a)    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in             part, without the other party's written consent (which will not be             unreasonably withheld), except that no such consent will be required             in connection with (i) a merger, reorganization or sale of all, or             substantially all, of such party's assets or (ii) either party's             assignment and/or delegation of its rights and responsibilities             hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary or joint venture in which the             assigning party holds an interest. Any attempt to assign this             Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and void.\n\n      b)    Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in             accordance with the laws of the State of New York, notwithstanding             the actual state or country of residence or incorporation of Excite             or Client.\n\n      c)    Notice.

This Agreement will not be             construed to create or imply any partnership, agency or joint             venture.\n\n      e)    Force Majeure. Any delay in or failure of performance by either             party under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this             Agreement and will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence             beyond the reasonable control of such party including, but not             limited to, acts of God, power outages and governmental             restrictions.\n\n      f)    Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this             Agreement are held to be unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, the             remaining portions of the Agreement will remain in full force and             effect.\n\n      g)    Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive             agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter             hereof, superseding any prior agreements and communications (both             written and oral) regarding\n\n                                       16\n\n                                                                    CONFIDENTIAL\n\n            such subject matter.
