WHEREAS, it is integral to Buyer's acquisition of the Company Business and a condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that the Sellers enter into this Agreement with Buyer to provide for the protection of the Combined Business's customer and vendor relationships, trade secrets, confidential information and other business operations. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Gulf Houghton shall receive cash consideration and shares of Buyer's capital stock in exchange for the Shares owned by Gulf Houghton and as inducement for Gulf Houghton and the other Sellers to enter into this Agreement. NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Confidentiality; Non-competition; Non-solicitation. (a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. (c) Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto. (d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. (e) It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area and degree of participation as is permitted by the Law of that jurisdiction whose Law is applicable to any acts allegedly in breach of such covenants. To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect. 2.

Injunctive Relief; Attorneys Fees. Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement.

Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nspecific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party.
