In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended          payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in          accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at          the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.

If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party.

If full  payment  is not  received          within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the          Managing  Group  of the  status  of the  matter  and  request  that the          Managing  Group  reclaim  the  capacity  in  TAT-14   assigned  to  the          defaulting Party.\n\n21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity          assigned  to a Party that is in default  with any  payment  required by          this  Agreement  or is in default  with any other  material  obligation          under this  Agreement,  if such default has existed for a period of six          (6)  months.   The  Managing  Group  shall  consider  any   extenuating          circumstances  not within the specific  control of the defaulting Party          and the  interests of any Party or Parties  that have jointly  assigned          capacity with the  defaulting  Party in  determining  whether or not to          reclaim  the  capacity  assigned  to such  defaulting  Party.  Prior to          reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in          writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity          after one (1) month.

The remaining Parties shall          not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the          reclaimed capacity.  Except for the rights and obligations as specified          in Paragraphs 25 and 29 the rights and obligations under this Agreement          of a defaulting  Party shall  terminate at the time the Managing  Group          reclaims all of the capacity previously assigned to a defaulting Party.
