The CEO Succession Committee and any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee the selection process for the New CEO shall not take any material action prior to the March Board Meeting.\n\n(b) In order to ensure an orderly transition, Mr. Koffel may in his sole discretion continue (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after the 2014 Annual Meeting) as the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company during the selection process for the New CEO until the Board shall appoint the New CEO, which shall not be later than the earlier of December 31, 2014, or Mr. Koffel's voluntary resignation from such positions; provided that Mr. Koffel will resign as a director of the Company and the Chairman of the Board upon the effectiveness of the Board's appointment of the New CEO; provided, further, that nothing contained herein is intended to modify any employment agreement, equity award, retirement plan or other pre-existing obligation of the Company to Martin Koffel or to impose any additional obligations on Martin Koffel (beyond the obligation to resign as provided in this Section 4(b)).

These four directors will be on URS' slate of directors nominated for election to the Board of Directors at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, along with eight incumbents, pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners LLC. The four new directors will be: Diane C. Creel, William H. Schumann, III,\n\nDavid N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh. Biographical information on the new directors is provided below.\n\nCurrent directors [A] and [B] have advised the Company that they do not plan to stand for re-election at the 2014\n\nAnnual Meeting. Therefore, from March 27, 2014 until the Annual Meeting, the Board will increase to fourteen members from the\n\ncurrent ten, but will be comprised of twelve directors following the 2014 Annual Meeting.\n\nUnder the agreement with JANA, URS will also form a Value Creation Committee of the Board that will evaluate all\n\noptions for enhancing shareholder value, including by engaging an investment bank to conduct a strategic review of the\n\nCompany's business segments, operations and capital structure, and reviewing the Company's management compensation structure to enhance alignment with shareholder value creation. The Committee will be comprised of four members, two of whom\n\nwill be new directors.\n\nMartin M. Koffel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of URS, stated: \"[A] and [B] are superb directors and have contributed much to our success, but each has decided for his own reasons not to stand for re-election. I and their fellow board\n\nmembers look forward to continuing to work with them until the Annual Meeting but will take this opportunity to express our\n\ngratitude for their service, sound counsel and friendship.\" Koffel continued: \"With [A]'s and [B]'s decisions to stand down and the expansion of our Board, we are adding four new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board on March 27 and we will nominate these directors for election at the\n\n2014 Annual Meeting. All are accomplished business leaders with experience\n\n\n\n\n\n  relevant to the URS enterprise, and we are confident that they will prove to be valuable additions as we continue working to build\n\nvalue for our stockholders.\" As previously disclosed, the URS Board has been engaged in succession planning for the Company's Chief Executive Officer position and has appointed a CEO Succession Committee comprised of independent directors. Two of the new directors\n\nwill promptly be appointed to this Committee. One of the new directors will also be appointed to the Compensation Committee.\n\nSaid Koffel, \"Having led URS for more than 25 years, I had previously communicated to the Board that it was important to have my successor in place in 2014, and our goal is to do just that. The Board has asked me to remain as Chairman and Chief\n\nExecutive Officer until a successor is named, which I expect to do unless circumstances change.\" Barry Rosenstein, Managing Partner of JANA Partners, said, \"We have appreciated our constructive dialogue with Martin Koffel and his team. We share their view that the Company is significantly undervalued, particularly given its strong cash\n\nflows and the valuable work Martin and his team have done over many years to ensure that URS is well-positioned to meet the\n\nneeds of its clients. I am confident that the addition of four highly-qualified directors and the formation of the Value Creation\n\nCommittee will help unlock this value for all shareholders.\" JANA Partners currently owns approximately 9.7 percent of the Company's common shares outstanding. URS' incumbent directors expected to be nominated for re\u00adelection at the 2014 Annual Meeting are: [C]; [D]; [E]; [F]; [G]; [H]; [I]; and [J].\n\nThe director nominations will be included in the Company's 2014 proxy statement and submitted for stockholder approval at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, [to be held on [date]]. The Company expects to file its proxy materials for the\n\n2014 Annual Meeting [in the near future] and encourages stockholders to review the proxy materials when they become available.\n\nThe agreement between URS and JANA Partners will be filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission. The agreement includes certain standstill restrictions that will be in effect until 30 days prior to the deadline by which\n\na shareholder must give notice to the Company of its intention to nominate a director at or bring other business before the 2015\n\nAnnual Meeting. JANA Partners has committed to\n\n\n\n\n\n  vote the shares that it controls in support of URS' twelve director nominees at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting.
