The resulting inability of Grantor     to grant the licenses purported to be granted by it under such Patents shall     not be considered to be a breach of the Patent License.  In such case, upon     request by the Grantee, Grantor shall make reasonable efforts to secure     rights and licenses for the Grantee from the third-party equivalent to those     provided in the Patent License.\n\n(b) Patents Subject to Exclusive Licenses.

Notwithstanding that such rights or such consent may be subject to the payment of a royalty or other consideration to any such third party as provided for in Section 6.09, and notwithstanding other conditions agreed with the third party, the grant of such licenses and rights shall otherwise be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Patent License.\n\nSection 6.09.
