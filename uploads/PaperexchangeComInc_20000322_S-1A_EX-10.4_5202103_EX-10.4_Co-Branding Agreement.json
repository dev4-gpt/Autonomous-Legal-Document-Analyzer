DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n      9.1. Negotiation and Escalation.

Arbitration. Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 9.2  [Arbitration]. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court\n\nSource: PAPEREXCHANGE COM INC, S-1/A, 3/22/2000\n\n\n\n\n\nhaving jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n      9.3. Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] of this Agreement by either party, the party alleging such a violation may seek temporary injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator. The party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the American Arbitration Association proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n      9.4. Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 9  [DISPUTE RESOLUTION], except that costs and expenses of the arbitrators shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other party.\n\n* Confidential Treatment Requested: material has been omitted and filed   separately with the Commission.\n\n                                       15\n\n      9.5.

Remedial Measures. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching party may take reasonable remediable measures at the cost of the breaching party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach. In addition, the non-breaching party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\n10. CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n      10.1. Confidentiality Obligations. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other party in confidence, (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties and (c) to promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential Information of the disclosing party and to reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of the disclosing party's right to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Neither party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, no less than reasonable care.\n\n      10.2. Exclusions.

Such disclosure shall not alter the status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.\n\n      10.3. Termination. Subject to Section 13.10  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement.

Injunction. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security.\n\n      10.5. Publicity. Except as may be required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (including those arising under any securities laws), neither party will originate any publicity, news release or other public announcement, written or oral, whether to the public press or otherwise, concerning the relationship between the parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event disclosure is required by applicable law, rules or regulations, then the party required to so disclose such information shall, to the extent possible, provide to the other party for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) a written copy of such public announcement at least five business days prior to disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall have the right to make a press release with respect to its entering into this Agreement; provided that such party provides to the other party a copy of the proposed press release no less than five business days prior to its proposed release and that the contents of such press release shall be subject to the other party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\n\n11.
