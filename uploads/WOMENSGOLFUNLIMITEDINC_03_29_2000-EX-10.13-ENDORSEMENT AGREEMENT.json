The Professional represents that no agent or representative fees, charges, rights or claims exist in connection with her execution or performance of this Agreement, and the Professional shall hold harmless the Company from any such liability. Any costs incurred by the Company to comply with any rule, contract, order or other requirement of SAG, AFTRA or other union or professional organization having control or jurisdiction over the Professional or her performance of the services required by this Agreement shall be deducted from the sums due from the Company to the Professional. The Professional agrees that the compensation provided to her under Section 4 of this Agreement shall be deemed compensation for purposes of meeting any minimum pay requirements of any SAG or AFTRA agreement. If any of the above terms are deemed to violate any SAG or AFTRA agreement, the Company shall have the option to terminate this Agreement without liability.\n\n         6.2 The Professional shall have no authority to incur expenses on behalf of the Company without the Company's prior written approval.

TERMINATION.\n\n         7.1 This Agreement shall terminate automatically if the Professional dies or becomes disabled, or suffers illness, mental or physical disability to the extent that she is unable to perform the obligations of the Professional under the terms of this Agreement.\n\n         7.2 Either the Company or the Professional may terminate this Agreement in the event of a non-curable breach of this Agreement by the other party.\n\n         7.3 In case of a breach of the Agreement that is capable of being cured, the non-breaching party shall, before terminating the Agreement, give the breaching party written notice of such breach, and a thirty (30) day period in which to cure such breach.\n\n         7.4 The Professional's obligations under (i) Section 9 hereof and (ii) Exhibit A shall survive a termination of this Agreement for the applicable periods set forth therein. The Company's obligation to compensate the Professional pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement shall cease on the effective date of termination except as to amounts earned by the Professional and due from the Company accruing prior to such date.\n\n         7.5 The right to terminate outlined in this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies which may be available to the non-breaching party, whether at law or in equity, for a breach of this Agreement.\n\n8.       RENEWAL.\n\n         8.1 The Company may renew this Agreement on the same terms and conditions for one (1) additional five year period that shall begin on January 1, 2005 and end on December 31, 2009, by providing a written notice of its intent to effect such renewal to the Professional by November 30, 2004.\n\n9.

The Professional acknowledges that she will have a right, pursuant to and under the\n\n                                      -6-    7\n\n                                                                  EXECUTION COPY\n\nconditions described in Section 4.2 above, to receive a specified royalty for inventory on hand at the expiration of the initial term, and accordingly hereby grants to the Company the right to fill any orders for, assemble components of, market, advertise, promote and sell any inventory of Products in its inventory existing at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, for a period not to exceed two (2) years after such expiration or termination of the original term.

RIGHT OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n         10.1 The Professional acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the covenants contained in Section 9 of this Agreement would actually or potentially deprive the Company of a substantial amount of sales and business value and that the amount of injury would be impossible or difficult to ascertain fully.

MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n         11.1. ENFORCEABILITY. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the enforceability or validity of the balance of the Agreement. In the event that any such provision should be or becomes invalid for any reason, such provision shall remain effective to the maximum extent permissible, and the parties shall consult and agree on a legally acceptable modification giving effect to the commercial objectives of the unenforceable or invalid provision, and every other provision of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n         11.2. ASSIGNABILITY. This Agreement is not assignable by the Professional but is assignable by the Company to any affiliate or successor entity.

The waiver by any          party of any right arising out of any breach by the other party shall          not be construed as a waiver of any right arising out of a subsequent          breach.\n\n                  11.4.
