NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Second Amendment to Exhibit A to Services Agreement. Exhibit A to the Services Agreement shall be, and here by is, supplemented with the following: \"3. Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement. The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. 4. Fundamental Analysis. The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser. 5. Quantitative Analysis. Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers. To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.\" 2. Miscellaneous. This Second Amendment shall be effective as of the date first above written upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment and this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, also shall remain in full force and effect without this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser does not trade in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account. This Second Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Second Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Second Amendment and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.
