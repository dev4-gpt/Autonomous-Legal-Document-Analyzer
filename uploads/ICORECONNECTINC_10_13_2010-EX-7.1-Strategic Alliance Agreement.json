OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES   \u25cfInitiate a multi tiered marketing approach, by mutual consent of both parties, to integrate the iMedicor HIPAA Compliant transport network as a communications network throughout the USA MCO user base, \u25cfThe overall project would also include the ClearLobby pharmaceutical and medical device marketing platform and other value added services as mutually agreed into the future, as a Phase II activity. \u25cfA phased in approach for each of the components listed above with the first being the introduction of the core iMedicor, HIPAA compliant communication / transport system into the USA MCO network.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u25cfThe integrated service will generate revenue sharing opportunities for both companies. \u25cfUSA MCO will allow access to their network to distribute promotional and educational material highlighting the value proposition of the iMedicor / USA MCO alliance. \u25cfAccess will only be through, and controlled by USA MCO \u25cfCommunication will be, but not limited to e-mail promotion, direct mail, bill stuffers, web site, newsletter or any other normal communication between USA MCO and their network of physicians and other healthcare providers upon mutual consent of both parties \u25cfAll material must be approved by USA MCO prior to any distribution to the USA MCO network. \u25cfOnce a physician or other healthcare provider enrolls in iMedicor they will become part of the regular internal iMedicor communications system. \u25cfEvery physician that enrolls in iMedicor, including those physicians or other qualified registrants into the iMedicor network that are invited into USA MCO physician communities, through the efforts of USA MCO will be tagged as originating from that source (the USA MCO network). \u25cfMonthly reports detailing revenue generated through subscriptions, ClearLobby or other methods will be detailed in the monthly reports. \u25cfAll revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any). \u25cfIMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor. \u25cfUSA MCO will not be responsible for any direct sales of the iMedicor communications system; USA MCO will not handle any customer service issues. All such activity will be referred to iMedicor. \u25cfInitially iMedicor will provide the three main attributes of the iMedicor network to the USA MCO provider base, physicians and other healthcare providers. \u25cfThose attributes are:   oA HIPAA compliant transport system for digital / electronic records and images,   oBuild and create community, patient-specific peer collaboration and expansion of referral networks,   oAccess to educational resources, certified, skill level and product / device specific. \u25cf\n\n2. COMPENSATION   \u25cfIMedicor will charge a subscription fee to participating USA MCO providers. The suggested monthly subscription would be $19.95 per month per subscriber. USA MCO would receive one third of the monthly subscription price, per month, per subscriber (approximately $6.65). All revenue sharing opportunities will be calculated for all parties after any credit card or other third party processing fees are deducted from the gross sale. \u25cfUSA MCO will be responsible for the marketing and initial / ongoing communication to their network highlighting the features of iMedicor, the value proposition, and their support of the project. This will not be a direct sales requirement for USA MCO, but only an agreement to provide access to the USA MCO user base \u25cfWithin 30 days of the execution of this agreement both companies agree to finalize a marketing plan that would detail they promotional activity to the USA MCO network, promotional deliverables, frequency of communication with the USA MCO network and other activities normally found in a strategic marketing plan \u25cfBoth companies agree to publish a press release, upon mutual agreement of content, in regard to the execution of this agreement and periodic updates of the success of this Strategic Alliance \u25cfIt is understood that iMedicor is a public company and is obligated to make certain SEC required filings that from time to time will include mention of the Strategic Alliance between iMedicor and USA MCO \u25cfIMedicor shall provide access to the iMedicor system, training and customer support as required. \u25cfUSA MCO will have the option to take all or part of its revenue share in equity up to a maximum of 4.9% ownership in iMedicor on a fully diluted basis. For the purposes of this proposal, fully diluted means all issued and outstanding stock warrants priced at 15 times the average 5 day closing price at the day previous to reconciliation of revenues, which will be the 20th of the month for the prior calendar month.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u25cfThe iMedicor bookkeeping system will detail the payment option prior to releasing any funds or commitment of stock in order for USA MCO to determine how payment is to be reconciled. It is anticipated that said report will be available by the 15th of the month for previous activity, returned to iMedicor by the 19th in order to effect a timely disbursement of funds and or stock \u25cfIt is understood that the issuance of stock certificates can take up to four weeks but the issue date will be the 20th of the month of reconcile. \u25cfEquity payout will be priced at the average 10 day trading day closing from the day previous to the monthly reconciliation. \u25cfIMedicor will provide a warrant to purchase 2 million shares of common stock to USA MCO to offset any up-front marketing expense incurred by USA MCO in this project. The value of the Warrants will be determined by the average 10 day closing price of iMedicor stock eliminating the two lowest days and the two highest days for the period as of the day before the actual execution of the final agreement. \u25cfThe Warrants will be issued as a non-cash-transaction upon exercise of the Warrant, and, USA MCO will have up to five years from the date of issuance to exe4cute. USA MCO will also have the option to purchase the Warrant for the face value if it deemed the purchase option to be more favorable to the cashless transaction. \u25cfIn addition to the subscription fees, iMedicor would offer a 17% revenue share (cash payout only) through revenues generated with its ClearLobby program. Clearlobby represents the Pharma / Medical Device marketing division inside iMedicor that will expose physicians and other providers within the USA MCO provider network to new products and services in a non-invasive, opt-in manner. ClearLobby will be the Phase II part of the relationship. \u25cfiMedicor will inform USA MCO of all ClearLobby activity as new products and services are introduced into the system \u25cfIMedicor will, from time to time make available upgrade services to its members.
