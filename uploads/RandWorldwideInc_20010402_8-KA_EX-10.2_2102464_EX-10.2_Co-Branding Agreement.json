However, should the Billing Party consider withholding payment or paying any such amount from payments due under this Agreement, the Billing Party shall send in advance to the other party a certificate setting forth the regulatory and/or legal framework for such a payment, including the provisions of the international tax treaty allowing such payment. The other party will have 30 days from the reception of such information to accept or refuse such payment/withholding:\n\nSource: RAND WORLDWIDE INC, 8-K/A, 4/2/2001\n\n\n\n\n\n    (i)  If the other party accepts or does not answer within this time frame,           the Billing Party will be entitled to make such payment/withholding           and shall provide the other party with a certificate stating the           amounts withheld and the jurisdictions to which such amounts were           remitted.\n\n    (ii) If the other party provides to the Billing Party a certificate stating           that (a) the Billing Party has no withholding/payment obligations with           respect to the laws of such particular jurisdiction and setting forth           the relevant authority for such statement and/or (b) that such a           payment may be avoided under any applicable law or treaty and provide           with the necessary documentation for that purpose, and if the Billing           Party then determines that it has no such withholding obligation under           the laws of such jurisdiction, the Billing Party shall make any future           payments to the other party without deduction for the items set forth           in the certificate, until such time as the Billing Party reasonably           believes that it has a withholding obligation.\n\nEither Party shall pay any applicable sales or value added tax on the payments due.\n\n                 5.4 Share of Net Revenue.
