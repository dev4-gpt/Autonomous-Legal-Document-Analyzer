Charity Tunes shall make its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format to the fullest extent that such  format is available to Charity Tunes pursuant to any agreements in effect between Charity Tunes and its wholesalers on the  date of this Agreement. Accordingly, Charity Tunes shall use its best efforts to update its music catalogue with available MP3  files by June 30, 2009.    The custom interactive landing page shall be designed, operated and maintained at the expense of Sponsor, and shall be  subject to the mutual approval by Charity Tunes and Sponsor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The landing  page shall feature the Charity Tunes logo in a size and prominence substantially equal to that of Sponsor.\n\nPOGO 8 pack, POGO 10 pack, POGO 20 pack and POGO 30 pack products sold at participating retail locations in Canada  (individually and collectively the \"Designated Sponsor Products\") are the only products for which a Pin Code will be  distributed and each consumer who purchases a Designated Sponsor Product will receive one and only one Pin Code while  supplies last and subject to the limitations detailed herein.

If the Pin Codes are made available to the  public by Sponsor or by any of its employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, representatives or advisors, except in  the manner provided for herein, all parties agree that Pin Code security will be deemed compromised, and Charity Tunes may  terminate all subsequent Pin Code redemptions.
