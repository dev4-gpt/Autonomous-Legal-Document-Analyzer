At the time of the filing of the Registration Statement and at the time of the use of any issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433(h) of the Securities Act Regulations, the Company met the conditions required by Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act Regulations for the use of a free writing prospectus. If required to be filed, the Company has filed any issuer free writing\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nprospectus related to the offered Securities at the time it is required to be filed under Rule 433 of the Securities Act Regulations and, if not required to be filed, will retain such free writing prospectus in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g) of the Securities Act Regulations and if any issuer free writing prospectus is used after the date hereof in connection with the offering of the Securities the Company will file or retain such free writing prospectus as required by Rule 433 of the Securities Act Regulations.\n\n(iii) As of the Applicable Time, neither (i) the Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus(es) issued at or prior to the Applicable Time and the Statutory Prospectus, all considered together (collectively, the \"General Disclosure Package\"), nor (ii) any individual Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The hour and date upon which the Company shall release for delivery all of the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the \"Closing Time.\"\n\nThe Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.\n\nIn addition to the reimbursement of the expenses specified in Section 4 hereof, the Agent will receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) One percent (1.00%) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Subscription and Community Offering, excluding in each case shares purchased by (i) any employee benefit plan of the Company or the Bank established for the benefit of their respective directors, officers and employees, and (ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or members of their immediate families (which term shall mean parents, grandparents, spouse, siblings, children and grandchildren); and\n\n(b) With respect to any Securities sold by a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder.

Financial Officer of the Company, of the MHCs and of the Bank, dated as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) they have reviewed the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (ii)

information included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus fairly present the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank and the Subsidiaries as of and for the dates and

Statement and covered by their opinions therein comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations; (iii)

unaudited consolidated financial statements and supporting schedules of the Company included in the Registration Statement do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Act Regulations and the OTS Regulations or are not presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (B) the unaudited amounts of net interest income and net income set forth under \"Selected Financial and Other Data\" in the Registration Statement and Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in unaudited consolidated financial statements

audited financial statements included in the Registration Statement, (C) at a specified date not more than five (5) business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there has been any increase in

compared with the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of financial conditions included in the Registration Statement or, (D) during the period from January 1, 2006 to a specified date not

(iii) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and which are specified by the Agent, and have found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank identified in such letter.\n\n(g) At Closing Time, the Agent shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP a letter, dated as of

with the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Agent and counsel for the Agent.\n\n(k) At any time prior to Closing Time, (i) there shall not have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis

sale of the Securities, and (ii) trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market shall not have been suspended, and minimum or maximum

INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n(a) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each person, if any, who controls the Agent, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and its respective partners, directors, officers, employees and agents as follows:\n\n(i) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, related to or arising out of the Offerings or any action taken by the Agent where acting as agent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or otherwise as described in Section 2 hereof;\n\n(ii) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, based upon or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;\n\n(iii) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and\n\n(iv) from and against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Agent), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation, proceeding or inquiry by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim pending or threatened whatsoever described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above;\n\nprovided, however, that the indemnification provided for in this paragraph (a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading which was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, their directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, of a material fact made in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to no more than one local counsel in each separate jurisdiction in which any action or proceeding is commenced) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank also agree that the Agent shall not have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the MHCs and its members, the Bank, the Company's, the MHCs's or the Bank's creditors relating to or arising out of the engagement of the Agent pursuant to, or the performance by the Agent of the services contemplated by, this Agreement.\n\n(e) In addition to, and without limiting, the provisions of Section (6)(a)(iv) hereof, in the event that the Agent, any person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents is requested or required to appear as a witness or otherwise gives testimony in any action, proceeding, investigation or inquiry brought by or on behalf of or against the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, the Agent or any of its respective affiliates or any participant in the transactions contemplated hereby in which the Agent or such person or agent is not named as a defendant, the Company, the MHCs, and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with preparing or appearing as a witness or otherwise giving testimony and to compensate the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents in an amount to be mutually agreed upon.\n\nSECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the MHCs or the Bank and the Agent, as incurred, in such proportions (i) that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the maximum aggregate\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nmarketing fees appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus bears to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds appearing thereon and the Company, the MHCs and the Bank are jointly and severally responsible for the balance or (ii) if, but only if, the allocation provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits to the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as reflected in clause (i), but also the relative fault of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent, and each director of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the MHCs or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, the MHCs and the Bank. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Agent be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the aggregate marketing fees to which the Agent is entitled and actually paid pursuant to this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities.\n\nSECTION 9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n(a) The Agent may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations, business affairs or prospects of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank, considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis the effect of which, in the judgment of the Agent, is so material and adverse as to make it impracticable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts, including subscriptions or orders, for the sale of the Securities, (iii) if trading generally on the Nasdaq Global Market, the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said Exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, Pennsylvania or New York authorities, (iv) if any condition specified in Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled; (v) if there shall have been such material adverse changes in the condition or prospects of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or the prospective market for the Company's Securities as in the Agent's\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\ngood faith opinion would make it inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities; (vi) if, in the Agent's good faith opinion, the price for the Securities established by the Appraiser is not reasonable or equitable under then prevailing market conditions, or (vii) if the Offerings are not consummated on or prior to June 30, 2007.\n\n(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 2 and 4 hereof relating to the reimbursement of expenses and except that the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 10.
