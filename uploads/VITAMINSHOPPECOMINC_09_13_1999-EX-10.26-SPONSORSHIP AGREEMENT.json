If Excite                           fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions                           required during any annual period, Client may suspend                           (but not eliminate) its payments specified in Section                           7 for a maximum of sixty (60) days (the \"Make-Good                           Period) during which Excite will deliver the                           shortfall of such impressions.  The parties agree to                           cooperate in good faith to evaluate the quality and                           performance of the placements used to deliver the                           impressions during the Make-Good Period.  Until such                           shortfall is delivered, no impressions will be deemed                           delivered for the next annual period.  If Excite has                           not achieved the required annual impression delivery                           by the end of the Make-Good Period, Client may then                           terminate this Agreement upon written notice within                           ten (10) days following the end of the Make-Good                           Period.  Client's termination of the Agreement in                           accordance with the previous sentence will not                           relieve Excite of its obligation to deliver any                           previously paid for but undelivered impressions.  If                           Excite achieves the annual impression delivery goal                           at any time during the Make-Good Period, the term of                           this Agreement will continue and Client shall                           immediately resume payment of the sponsorship and                           advertising fees specified in Section 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    9    10                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

Descriptions of the services and technologies to be leveraged throughout the\n\n\n\n\n\noptimization process are highlighted below.\n\nCENTRALIZED AD SERVING Through its proprietary centralized ad serving infrastructure, MatchLogic will facilitate the trafficking, delivery, tracking and reporting of Client's banners throughout the Excite Network.  During the ad management process, MatchLogic will employ TrueCount(sm) cache counting techniques as the underlying measurement technology for the reporting of client campaign performance data.  Basic campaign performance data including primary impressions, clicks, click %, cache impressions and total impressions will be supplied to Client daily through an online interface.\n\nTRUEFFECT(sm) TruEffect(sm) refers to the process of establishing, tracking and communicating the relationship between locations from which users have interacted with Client's marketing messages and the activities they engaged in at the Client Site as a result of these interactions.  TruEffect(sm) measurement will allow Client to directly relate user activity within the Client Site to marketing messages within the Excite Network.  As a result of these measurements, Client will have the ability to optimize campaigns in order to drive actual user activities or transactions.  Client will be able to identify the number of unique visitors coming to the Client Site or promotional areas, from which message and area they originated, and the number of measurable transactions these visitors performed.  Additionally, measurements of reach and frequency will accompany this analysis.\n\nUpon successful implementation of TruEffect(sm), performance reporting will be available to Client on a daily basis through an online interface.\n\nLANDSCAPE(sm) LandscapE(sm) demographic profile reports will afford Client an effective means of understanding the visitor segments exposed to Client's messages or interacting with Client sponsored content areas within the Excite Network.  All of the information contained within the demographic profiles is derived from consumers who have been both exposed to an advertising campaign and are also within MatchLogic's Digital 1:1(sm) database (MatchLogic's proprietary consumer database).  When a subset of unique visitors taken from all visitors exposed to a Client's marketing message or content area are matched against the Digital 1:1(sm) database, demographic profiles are derived.  The matched records create a sample of visitors that are used to demographically represent and statistically profile\n\n                                    19    20                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

These profiles will allow Client to compare its understanding of its customers offline to its customers online as a basis for more effective segmenting and future targeting.\n\nLandscapE(sm) reports are generated on a campaign basis and will include measurements of campaign reach by Age, Gender, Age/Gender, Household Income, and Household Income/Age.  These reports will be made available to Client once statistically significant profiles have been established.\n\nTRUESELECT(sm) TrueSelect(sm) is MatchLogic's centralized advertising targeting system. TrueSelect(sm) enables MatchLogic to project demographics of users across the Internet based on our Digital 1:1 database, user traffic and user search patterns.  The first implementation of this technology will be Virtual Keywords slated for release in 4Q98.  Virtual Keywords will allow MatchLogic to actively target a user on the Excite Network based on the user's input of search terms at a previous point in time.  TrueSelect(sm) will be able to track and target users by Virtual Keywords on both an inter-day and intra-day basis.  Following Virtual Keywords, TrueSelect(sm) capabilities will enable marketers to actively target specific users based on predetermined demographic or lifestyle information in real time.\n\nUpon release of this technology, delivery of TrueSelect(sm) targeted messaging for Client is highly dependent on a number of qualifying criteria.  A critical qualifier for the implementation of TrueSelect(sm) will be the establishment of a significant behavioral profile target for Client's customers as highlighted within the LandscapE(sm) services description above.\n\nDELIVERE(sm) DeliverE(sm), MatchLogic's email marketing service will be leveraged to deliver email marketing campaigns on behalf of Vitamin Shoppe.  The DeliverE(sm) team will consult with Client to evaluate current business objectives (branding, acquisition, retention, reactivation, etc.) and develop e-mail strategies that meet these specific objectives.  Once appropriate strategies have been established, MatchLogic will target both MatchLogic and Excite registered users for the facilitation of the Client's program.  Performance results for these campaigns will be provided to Client and assist in the development of strategies for subsequent e-mail campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected delivery schedules for DeliverE(sm) services over the [*****]-year term of this agreement are as follows.\n\n                                    20    21                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
