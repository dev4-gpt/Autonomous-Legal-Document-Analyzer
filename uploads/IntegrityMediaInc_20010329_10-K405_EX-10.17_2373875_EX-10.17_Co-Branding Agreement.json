Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\n\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \"Songs 4 Worship\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs.
