(\"AGI\"), a Delaware corporation having its principal office located at 2575 Vista Del Mar Drive, Ventura, California 93001 (each a \"Party\" and collectively the \"Parties\").\n\n               WHEREAS, the Company is a multi-state chain of dealerships engaged in the retail sales of service of recreational vehicles (the \"Business\"); and\n\n               WHEREAS, AGI, either directly or through subsidiaries, operates the \"Good Sam\" club for recreational vehicle enthusiasts; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the Company has determined that it would be beneficial sell vehicles with the Good Sam endorsement; and\n\n               WHEREAS, the Company has raised capital that it represents will be sufficient to fund its operations as projected for at least the next year and AGI is willing to make the Good Sam name available as an endorsement for certain vehicles sold by the Company on the terms and for the consideration set forth herein.\n\n               NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\n\n        1. License of Good Sam Name and Logo.\n\n               A. AGI hereby grants a non-exclusive license (the \"License\") to the Company and its operating subsidiaries now or hereafter existing to use the Good Sam name and logo, including trademarks, trade names, or service marks as designated by AGI (the \"Trademarks\"), in connection with the sale of such new and used vehicles by the Company that have satisfied such criteria and standards as are established from time to time by AGI (the \"Approved Use\"). AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this\n\n                                      -1-\n\nAgreement, AGI will defend such claim at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim.

In order to protect the good will of AGI and the Good Sam club, AGI retains the right to review and approve in advance and in its sole discretion, all uses of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo. Therefore, the Company shall give AGI at least ten business days prior written notice and description of intended use by the Company of the Trademark and the Good Sam name and logo, and the Company's use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is subject to approval of AGI.\n\n               C. The Company agrees that its use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is restricted to the Approved Use, and the Company shall not use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo for any other purpose.

The terms of the marketing program will be set forth in a marketing agreement between AGI and the Company. The marketing agreement will provide, among other things, the terms pursuant to which the Company shall make \"Fulfillment Deposits\" for warranty products sold as a part of the marketing program.\n\n        6.
