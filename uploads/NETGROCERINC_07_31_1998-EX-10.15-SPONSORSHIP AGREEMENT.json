This election will not relieve NetGrocer of its obligation to                   make Click-through payments on non--banner Impressions.\n\n         g)       In its sole discretion, during the second year of the term of                   the Agreement, NetGrocer may elect to terminate the display                   of its banner advertising on the Excite Network once the                   number of Click-throughs on the promotional placements and                   advertising banners described in Section 1 (a) - (d) exceeds                   [*] in the second year of the term of the Agreement. This                   election will not relieve NetGrocer of its obligation to make                   Click-through payments on non-banner Impressions.\n\n         h)       The one-time sponsorship initiation fee, sponsorship and                   advertising fees and Click-through payments are net of any                   agency commissions to be paid by NetGrocer.\n\n         i)       During the term of the Agreement, on a weekly basis, Excite                   will provide NetGrocer with a detailed report showing the                   number of Impressions of the advertising banners described in                   Section 1 (a) - (d) and the number of Click-throughs on the                   advertising banners described in Section 1 (a) - (d).\n\n         j)       During the term of the Agreement, within twenty (20) days                   following the end of each calendar month, Excite will send                   NetGrocer a detailed report showing the number of Impressions                   of the different promotional placements and text links                   described in Section 1 (a) - (d) and the number of                   Click-throughs on the promotional placements described in                   Section 1 (a) - (d).\n\n         k)       Excite will maintain accurate records with respect to                   calculation of all payments due under this Agreement.                   NetGrocer may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior                   written notice to Excite cause an independent Certified                   Public Accountant to inspect the records of Excite reasonably\n\n                                      -8-\n\n                  related to the calculation of such payments during Excite's                   normal business hours. The fees charged by such Certified                   Public Accountant will be paid by NetGrocer unless the audit                   finds a discrepancy of more than five percent (5%) with                   respect to the item being audited, in which case Excite shall                   be responsible for the payment of the reasonable fees for                   such inspection.\n\n6.       PUBLICITY\n\n                  Neither party will make any public statement, press release                   or other announcement relating to the terms of or existence                   of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the                   other party, except as may be required to the extent advised                   by counsel for a party that such disclosure is necessary or                   appropriate to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding                   the foregoing, the parties agree to issue an initial press                   release regarding the relationship between Excite and                   NetGrocer, the timing and wording of which will be mutually                   agreed upon,.\n\n7.       OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         a)       Excite currently plans to develop a consumer packaged goods                   (\"CPG\") program that would combine the broad reach of the                   Excite Network with the depth of CPG merchants' industry\n\n\n\n\n\n                  contacts and sales staffs. Under this program, Excite and                   each CPG merchant would develop co-branded Web pages on the                   Excite Network that would promote the merchant's goods cr                   provide content of interest to Excite's users. Excite would                   run dual promotional efforts, one that sends consumers to                   each CPG merchant's co-branded area and a second that sends                   consumers to the portion of the Excite Network that promotes                   the entire CPG program. Excite and NetGrocer agree to                   negotiate in good faith to establish the terms and conditions                   for NetGrocer's participation in Excite's CPG program when                   and if launched.\n\n         b)       Excite currently plans to make available sponsorship                   opportunities on its WebCrawler Site (located at                   http://www.webcrawler.com) generally similar to the                   opportunity described by this Agreement, with the significant                   exception that merchants will not be granted category                   exclusivity or rights to exclude competitors on the                   WebCrawler Site. Excite and NetGrocer agree to negotiate in                   good faith to establish the terms and conditions for                   NetGrocer's participation in available sponsorship                   opportunities on the WebCrawler Site when and if launched.\n\n                                      -9-\n\n8.

Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of                   a party's obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or                   trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party will be                   entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other                   available legal remedies in a court of competent                   jurisdiction.\n\n                                      -12-\n\n         b)       In the event of disputes between the parties arising from or                   concerning in any manner the subject matter of this\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, the parties will first attempt to resolve                   the dispute(s) through good faith negotiation. In the event                   that the dispute(s) cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation, the parties will refer the dispute(s) to a                   mutually acceptable mediator for hearing.\n\n         c)       In the event that disputes between the parties arising from                   or concerning in any manner the subject matter of this                   Agreement, other than disputes arising from or concerning                   trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or                   confidentiality, cannot be resolved through good faith                   negotiation and mediation, the parties will refer the                   dispute(s) to the American Arbitration Association for                   resolution through binding arbitration by a single arbitrator                   pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's rules                   applicable to commercial disputes.\n\n14.

Notwithstanding the                   foregoing, either party may terminate the Agreement in the                   event that a delay due to force majeure continues for a                   period of sixty (60) uninterrupted days.\n\n         f)       Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this                   Agreement are held by to be unenforceable by a court or                   arbitrator, the remaining portions of the Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n         g)       Entire Agreement.
