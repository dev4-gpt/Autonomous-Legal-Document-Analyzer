    "context": "Exhibit 10.41\n\nSPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT\n\nThis Sponsorship Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into effective January 1, 2010 by and between Stallings Capital Group  Consultants, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership dba Bob Stallings Racing (\"Racing\"), and GAINSCO, INC., a Texas corporation (the \"Sponsor\").\n\nRacing organized and operated a racing team engaging in Daytona Prototype Series auto racing (the \"Racing Team\") in professional races in  2005 through 2008, and the Sponsor was the primary sponsor of the Racing Team pursuant to Sponsorship Agreements dated February 7, 2005,  February 1, 2006, January 1, 2007, January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009. Racing has invited the Sponsor to continue to act as the primary sponsor of  the Racing Team for 2010, and the Sponsor desires to act in that capacity. In consideration of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, the parties  desire to enter into this Agreement to govern the terms of such sponsorship in 2010.\n\nNow, therefore, Racing and the Sponsor hereby agree as follows:\n\n1. Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, the term of this Agreement and the sponsorship described herein shall commence on  January 1, 2010 and extend through December 31, 2010.\n\n2. Advertising and Other Benefits. Subject to payment by the Sponsor of the sponsorship fee provided for herein, during the term of this  Agreement Racing shall cause the Racing Team to provide for the Sponsor's benefit all of the benefits customarily associated with the  sponsorship of a Daytona Prototype Series racing team and consistent with the benefits provided to the Sponsor in 2005 - 2009 (individually, a  \"Benefit,\" and collectively, the \"Benefits\"), including but not limited to the following:   (i) displaying prominent identification of the Sponsor's name and/or logo in signage on the race car and racing suits and, where  appropriate, on other team equipment (subject to approval by the Sponsor);   (ii) making available for the use of the Sponsor (x) the personalities associated with the Racing Team, including without limitation  the name, voice, picture, portrait, likeness, persona and/or signature of each driver for endorsements, commercial advertising and  promotions in any and all media throughout the world during the term of this Agreement, (y) the Racing Team's home base facilities in  Texas, and (z) those facilities designated or assigned for the use of the Racing Team at each race and race location at which the Racing  Team actually participates in the race, all for appropriate public relations and other promotional and marketing purposes. Racing agrees  that it will actively participate in the Rolex 24 at Daytona in January, 2010. As it concerns (y) and (z) above, access shall be subject to  appropriate security and safety restrictions designated by the applicable racing location and the Racing Team;\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) making available for the use of the Sponsor a non-racing look-alike (a \"Show Car\") of the GAINSCO 99 race car (the \"Car\")  used by the Racing Team. Subject to the Sponsor's first right to use the Show Car, it will also be made available to Racing when such  use does not interfere with the Sponsor's use of the Show Car;   (iv) allowing the Sponsor the use of the likeness of the Car, including all paint and graphics, for promotion and advertising of or  by the Sponsor, and Racing shall be responsible for all necessary consents and permissions from any other sponsors to be sure the  Sponsor can use the likeness of the Car as specified herein;   (v) prohibiting the endorsement by Racing and any members of Racing, including the drivers, of any entities, products or  services which are in direct competition or otherwise inconsistent with the Sponsor or it products or services, unless such  endorsement activity is approved in writing by Racing and the Sponsor; and   (vi) allowing the Sponsor to use the conference room and other areas of the racing shop and garage for meetings and similar  events, provided that the Sponsor gives prior notice of the need for such use, and such use does not interfere with operations of the  racing shop and garage and is otherwise consistent with reasonable requirements imposed by Racing to assure orderly operations and  provide for adequate safety measures at all times.\n\n3. Sponsorship Fee. The Sponsor shall pay to Racing a sponsorship fee in the amount of $750,000.00 for the term of this Agreement, payable  in an initial installment payable on or before February 1, 2010 in the amount of $350,000.00 and ten installments of $40,000.00 on or before the first  day of each month commencing March 1, 2010 and ending with the installment due on December 1, 2010 (unless this Agreement is sooner  terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof, in which case Sponsor shall have no obligation to make any payments after the date of termination).\n\n4. Compliance with Applicable Rules and Regulations. Provision of the Benefits pursuant to this Agreement is subject to rules and  requirements of each organization and venue hosting a racing event in which the Racing Team competes during the term hereof, and the Sponsor  agrees to submit to Racing all advertising and other promotional material relating to each such event in sufficient time to enable Racing to assure  compliance with such rules and requirements. If as a result of such rules and requirements Racing is unable to provide a Benefit in the form  requested by the Sponsor, Racing shall be permitted to provide a substitute promotion or advertisement in compliance with such requirements.      2\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Sponsor's Maximum Obligation; Indemnification.

Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors,  agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the  Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.\n\n6. Retention of Rights. The only rights granted to the Sponsor hereunder are the right to receive the Benefits, and Racing hereby retains all  other rights with respect to the Racing Team, including but not limited to logos, symbols, names and other marks and intellectual property of the  Racing Team, and any proceeds derived by the Racing Team. The Sponsor hereby retains and does not grant any rights to Racing to use any of its  logos, symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property, except for use as described in Section 2 hereof. In the event that this Agreement is  terminated or if the sponsorship terminates at the end of the term provided for herein, each of the parties shall retain the rights to use its logos,  symbols, names or other marks or intellectual property including, in the case of the Sponsor, the right to use the names and marks \"GAINSCO 99\",  \"the GAINSCO 99 Car\", or similar phrases or derivations thereof.\n\n7. Relationship to Other Sponsors. The Sponsor acknowledges that Racing has arranged and may arrange in the future for other sponsors  for the Racing Team. Racing agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall have the right to approve or disapprove any  additional sponsor identified by Racing, and (ii) unless another proposed sponsor has agreed to pay a sponsorship fee that exceeds the amount  paid by Sponsor, no other sponsor shall receive any benefit of greater value (including either an equivalent or a more prominent use of another  sponsor's name, logo or other identifying information) than the Benefits provided to the Sponsor hereunder.\n\n8. Insurance.   (a) Racing shall obtain and maintain, at Racing's expense, comprehensive automobile liability insurance covering all owned, non-owned and  hired vehicles used by Racing in the Business with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence combined single limit for personal injury and  property damage, including all statutory coverage for all states of operation. Racing shall also provide comprehensive (fire and theft) and collision  insurance on each vehicle used in the Business.
