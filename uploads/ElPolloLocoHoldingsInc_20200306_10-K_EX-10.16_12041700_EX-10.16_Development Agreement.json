Developer represents that in entering into this Agreement it has relied solely on its personal knowledge and has not relied on any representations of Franchisor or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, except those representations contained in any legally required Franchise Disclosure Document delivered to Developer.\n\nC.  Developer desires to obtain development rights for multiple restaurants under the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified geographical (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (or if single unit, replace with \"Developer desires to obtain development rights for a single restaurant under the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified address (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\")\n\nD.Franchisor is willing to grant the (non-exclusive/exclusive) right to develop and open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) within the Territory referenced in Exhibit \"A.\"\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n1.Development Rights in Territory.\n\n1.1.

(If exclusive agreement, add \"Developer expressly acknowledges that the exclusive rights granted herein apply only to the right to develop new restaurants in the Territory, and no exclusive territory or radius protection for the term of any Franchise Agreement is granted herein and any such protection shall be set forth in the particular Franchise Agreement to be signed.\") The Franchise Agreements (and all ancillary documents attached as Exhibits to the Franchise Agreement, including the Personal Guarantee) executed in accordance with this Agreement shall be in the form currently in use by Franchisor at the time of execution of the Franchise Agreement and shall be executed individually by each person, partner, member or shareholder.\n\n1.2.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 hereof, after the date of this\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement and during the term of this Agreement, and so long as Developer is in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, Franchisor shall neither, without Developer's prior written consent: (i) grant development rights to anyone else with respect to the Territory or any part of the Territory; nor (ii) establish or franchise any person to establish an El Pollo Loco restaurant under the Marks and System at any location within the Territory. Franchisor expressly retains all other rights and may, among other things, on any terms and conditions Franchisor deems advisable, and without granting Developer any rights therein:\n\na. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate an El Pollo Loco restaurant located outside of the Territory;\n\nb. Sell the same or similar products (whether or not using the Marks), as will be sold by Developer in a developed El Pollo Loco restaurant, to customers at any retail location (whether within or outside of the Territory), through any method or channel of distribution, including, without limitation, at retail locations such as grocery or convenience stores and via the Internet, telemarketing and direct marketing means, through other non-El-Pollo Loco restaurants having the same or similar menu items, or through any other distribution channel;\n\nc. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate restaurants (not using the Marks) having the same or similar menu items whether within or outside of the Territory; and\n\nd. Any continued operation by Franchisor, or the allowance of any continued operation by a franchisee of Franchisor, of an El Pollo Loco restaurant within the Territory which was opened on or before the date of this Agreement shall not be considered to constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n1.3. (Only applies to multi-unit Development Agreement - delete if single-unit Development Agreement). Prior to or concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Developer shall meet with Franchisor's development representatives and prepare a market development plan for the units to be constructed and opened by Developer in the Territory (identifying specific key areas, key intersections and trade areas in the Territory) and all development pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with this plan (the \"Market Plan\"). The Market Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Developer and Franchisor shall jointly approve the Market Plan.\n\n2. Limitation on Development Rights.\n\n2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\n\n2.2. For purposes of the Development Schedule in Exhibit \"B\", no credit will be given for the development of El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) outside the Territory, regardless of the fact that Developer may, upon proper application, obtain from Franchisor an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Franchise Agreement (\"Franchise Agreement\") for any such development.\n\n2.3. Although this Agreement affords the Developer the right to develop and open El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurant(s) within the Territory, as set forth on Exhibit \"A\", all Restaurant(s) developed under this Agreement must be duly licensed through individual Franchise Agreement(s). Developer will execute El Pollo Loco's then standard Franchise Agreement in use at the time of execution for each restaurant developed under this Agreement, and agrees to pay Franchisor the current fees, royalties and other required payments in accordance with the Franchise Agreement and Franchise Disclosure Document then in effect. Execution of the appropriate Franchise Agreement and payment of the initial franchise fee and/or any other required fees must be accomplished prior to the commencement of construction at any site.\n\n2.4. Developer must satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect and in addition, if Developer is also a Franchisee of one or more El Pollo Loco Restaurants, Franchisee must also be in good standing with Franchisor and satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect prior to El Pollo Loco's execution of each standard Franchise Agreement issued pursuant to this Agreement. Developer shall provide Franchisor with current information pertaining to Developer's financial condition and the financial condition of the majority and managing members/partners/shareholders of Developer at any time upon El Pollo Loco's request and in no event less than once annually. Developer acknowledges that, among other things, it will be\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nrequired to submit annual financial statements of Developer and personal financial statements of each of its principal owners and Managing Members to be eligible for financial approval by El Pollo Loco. In the event any of the majority owners of Developer shall also be the Managing Members and/or majority owners of any other entity which is a franchisee of El Pollo Loco, then each such franchisee entity must be operationally and financially approved by Franchisor before approval for expansion will be granted to any one franchisee entity. \"Managing Members\" shall be any individuals who are designated as the primary decision makers or general managers of the franchisee entity and those individuals who (individually or collectively) own at least 51% interest in the franchisee entity.\n\n2.5. Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), together with such site information as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the \"Approved Site\". Such acceptance will expire one (1) year from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.\n\n2.6. Franchisor shall send representatives to evaluate proposed site(s) for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, and Franchisor will do so at its own expense for the first two (2) proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. If Developer proposes, and Franchisor evaluates, more than two (2) sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant, then Developer shall reimburse Franchisor for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Franchisor's representatives in connection with the evaluation of such additional proposed site(s), including, without limitation, the costs of lodging, travel, meals and wages.\n\n2.7. Provided there exists no default by Developer under this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Franchisor and Developer, Franchisor shall evaluate each site proposed for which Developer has provided all necessary evaluation information, and shall promptly after receipt of Developer's proposal, send to Developer written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the sit\n\n2.8. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may impact sales at any company-owned El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to accept or reject the proposed site, without any obligation to discuss a possible resolution with Developer. However, Franchisor may elect to discuss with Developer a possible resolution with regard to the proposed site; however, if such an agreement cannot be reached, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to reject the proposed site. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may potentially impact sales at any existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisee's restaurant, Franchisor shall notify Developer of the existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisees' location(s) and contact information. If nevertheless Developer wishes to try to proceed with that site, Developer must obtain a written waiver from those existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisees of any claims they might have against Developer and Franchisor with respect to the proposed new El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. Such waiver, if obtained, must be submitted along with the evaluation information required pursuant to this Section.\n\n2.9. No later than the Site Commitment Dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\", Developer shall submit for the Approved Site to Franchisor for its review and approval of:\n\na. A fully negotiated but unexecuted lease, which may only subject to obtaining necessary governmental permits. The unexecuted form of the lease must be submitted to Franchisor to review for the required terms and conditions listed in Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below prior to full execution of the lease. Franchisor will promptly notify Developer upon their approval of the inclusion of such required terms and conditions. Developer will promptly then provide a final executed copy of the lease to Franchisor; or\n\nb. A purchase agreement. Should Developer purchase the site using another entity other than the franchise entity, Developer must then enter into a lease with the Franchise entity as the lessee and the purchasing entity as the lessor and must comply with all the requirements of this Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below).\n\n2.10. Any lease to be entered into by Developer shall include the terms and conditions set forth below and in a form approved by Franchisor:\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\na. The tenant entity on the lease must match the franchise entity on the franchise agreement; and\n\nb. The term (with renewal options) of the lease must match at least the initial term of the franchise agreement; and\n\nc. The landlord consents to your use of the premises as an El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurant which will be open during the required days and hours set out in the Operations Manual.\n\n2.11. Franchisor shall have no liability under any lease or purchase agreement for any El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant location developed under this Agreement and shall not guarantee Developer's obligations thereunder. Upon approval by Franchisor of the form of Developer's lease and execution of a lease for a site by Developer, Developer shall furnish to Franchisor a fully executed copy of such lease and any amendments thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days of such execution. Franchisor shall have no obligation to assist Developer to negotiate its leases.\n\n2.12. The lease or deed may not contain a non-competition covenant which restricts Franchisor or any franchisee or licensee of Franchisor, from operating an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or any other retail restaurant, unless such covenant is approved by Franchisor in writing prior to the execution by Developer of the lease.\n\n2.13. Each subsequent site to be developed pursuant to the Development Schedule shall be submitted for approval by RESAC by the date set forth in Exhibit \"B\". Similarly, each fully executed lease (executed upon prior review and approval by Franchisor) or purchase agreement (with all contingencies to Developer's obligations waived or satisfied, except permitting contingencies) relating to each subsequent Approved Site shall: (1) be delivered to Franchisor on or before the Site Commitment Date for each respective El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant as set forth in Exhibit \"B\" and (2) prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements (3) prior to the payment of your initial Franchise Fees for each site and (4) prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant.\n\n2.14. RESAC site approval does not assure that a Franchise Agreement will be executed. Execution of the Franchise Agreement is contingent upon Developer completing the purchase or lease of the proposed site within sixty (60) days after approval of the site by the Franchisor or no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as Site Committment Dates.\n\n2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.\n\n2.16. Developer also acknowledges that it is required pursuant to this Agreement to open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants in the future pursuant to dates set forth in the Development Schedule attached as Exhibit \"B\". If Developer fails to meet the opening date for any El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, Developer shall be in default and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to Franchisor set forth in Section 11. Developer acknowledges that if Developer fails to open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants in a timely manner pursuant to the Development Schedule, Franchisor will suffer lost revenues, including royalties and other fees which would be difficult to calculate and which Franchisor would have received had Developer met the agreed schedule or had Franchisor had the right to grant development rights to others in the Territory.\n\n2.17. Developer acknowledges that the estimated initial investment and estimated expenses set forth in Items 6 and 7 of our Franchise Disclosure Document are subject to and likely to increase over time, and that future El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants will likely involve a greater initial investment and operating capital requirements than those stated in the Franchise Disclosure Document provided to you prior to your execution of this Agreement.\n\n2.18. Developer understands and acknowledges that in accepting Developer's proposed site or by granting a franchise for each approved site, Franchisor does not in any way, endorse, warrant or guarantee either directly or indirectly the suitability of such site or the success of the franchise business to be operated by Developer at such site. The suitability of the site and the success of the franchise business depend upon a number of factors outside of Franchisor's control, including, but not limited to, the Developer's operational abilities, site location, consumer trends and such other factors that are within the direct control of the Developer. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n2.19. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote orderly incremental growth within the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System. The acquisition of existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurants by Developer does not represent incremental growth and, therefore, does not satisfy the terms of this Agreement pertaining to development.\n\n2.20. (To be added where there are existing restaurants in the Territory) Developer acknowledges that Franchisor (i) is operating or has franchised another to operate, one (1) or more restaurants in the Territory or (ii) has granted franchise rights to another in the Territory or (iii) approved a new site for development for those locations identified in Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Developer further acknowledges that Franchisor retains the sole and absolute right to approve or disapprove any proposed location for development under this Agreement if, in Franchisor's reasonable judgment: (i) such proposed location is not suitable for an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or (ii) such proposed location will have a material adverse effect on the profitability of another existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae location (or approved site) in the Territory. Developer covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid selecting proposed locations that would adversely impact pre-existing locations in the Territory.\n\n3. Development Fee.\n\n3.1. Developer shall pay to Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement a non-refundable Development Fee (the \"Development Fee\") equal to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) in immediately available funds, for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement. The Development Fee is consideration for this Agreement. The Development Fee is not consideration for any Franchise Agreement and is non-refundable. The $20,000 Development Fee for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant shall be applied against the initial franchise fee payable upon the execution of the Franchise Agreement applicable to such El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. As a benefit of signing the Development Agreement, the Initial Fee for the second and each subsequent restaurant developed under the same Development Agreement will be reduced by us to $30,000. As an example, the Initial Fee for the first restaurant developed under a Development Agreement would be $40,000 to which $20,000 (from the Development Fee will be credited. The Initial Fee for the second and remaining restaurants developed under the same Development Agreement would be $30,000, to which $20,000 from the Development Fee will be credited. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10 or 11 below, Developer will lose its right to develop and Development Fee.\n\n4. Term of Development Agreement.\n\n4.1. This Agreement shall commence on the date specified in Exhibit \"B\". Unless terminated pursuant to Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or upon the opening of the last El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.\n\n5. Territory Conflicts.\n\n5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution of a General Release.\n\n5.2. In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine, that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.\n\n6. Proprietary Rights of El Pollo Loco. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1. Developer expressly acknowledges El Pollo Loco's exclusive right, title, and interest in an to the trade name, service mark and trademark \"El Pollo Loco\", and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks which are designated as part of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (the \"Marks\"), and Developer agrees not to represent in any manner that Developer has any ownership in El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks. This Agreement is not a Franchise Agreement. Developer may not open an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or use the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks at a particular site until it executes a Franchise Agreement for that site. Developer's use of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks shall be limited to those rights granted under each individual Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, El Pollo Loco\u00ae may authorize Developer in writing to use the Marks in connection with advertising and marketing activities in connection with this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that such usage is limited to those specific activities or promotional materials approved by El Pollo Loco's marketing department in advance. Developer further agrees that its use of the Marks shall not create in its favor any right, title, or interest in or to El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks, but that all of such use shall inure to the benefit of El Pollo Loco, and Developer has no rights to the Marks except to the degree specifically granted by the individual Franchise Agreement(s). Building designs and specifications, color schemes and combinations, sign design specifications, and interior building layouts (including equipment, equipment specification, equipment layouts, and interior color schemes and combinations) are acknowledged by Developer to comprise part of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System. Developer shall have no right to license or franchise others to use the Marks by virtue of this Agreement.\n\n6.2. Developer acknowledges that, in connection with its execution of this Agreement, it may receive confidential and proprietary information regarding the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System, including but not limited to the El Pollo Loco Operational Manual. Developer recognizes the unique value and secondary meaning attached to the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks and the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System, and Developer agrees that any noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement or any unauthorized or improper use will cause irreparable damage to Franchisor and its franchisees. Developer, therefore, agrees that if it should engage in any such unauthorized or improper use during, or after, the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall be entitled to both seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other remedies prescribed by law.\n\n6.3. Developer acknowledges that it will receive one (1) copy of the Operations Manual on loan from Franchisor and that the Operations Manual shall at all times remain the sole property of the Franchisor.\n\n7. Insurance and Indemnification.\n\n7.1. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.\n\n7.2. Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on all such insurance policies and shall be provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage. All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.\n\n7.3. Franchisor reserves the right to specify reasonable changes in the types and amounts of insurance coverage required by this Section 7. In the event that Developer fails or refuses to obtain or maintain the required insurance coverage from an insurance carrier acceptable to El Pollo Loco, Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right and without any obligations to do so, procure such coverage for Developer. In such event, Developer shall pay the required premiums or reimburse such premiums to Franchisor upon written demand.\n\n7.4. Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as \"Franchisor\"), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as \"Losses\"), however caused, and reimburse Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nany reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer's duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer's duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer's negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer's duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens or damages.\n\n7.5. Developer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Franchisor (as defined above) from and against any and all Losses (as defined above), however caused, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from latent or other defects in the restaurant whether or not discoverable by Franchisor, and those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor from all said Losses and shall pay for and be responsible for all said Losses, however caused, whether by any individual, employee, third person or party, vendor, visitor, invitee, trespasser or any firm or corporation whatsoever, whether caused by or contributed to by Franchisor, the combined conduct of Developer and Franchisor, or active or passive negligence of Franchisor, but for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of Franchisor.\n\n7.6. The provisions of this Section 7 shall expire as to each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement upon execution of a Franchise Agreement for such El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. The provision of the Franchise Agreement, in particular, Section 9 thereof (insurance and Indemnification) shall supersede this Section 7 and govern the rights and obligations of the parties prospectively.\n\n8. Transfer of Rights.\n\n8.1. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Franchisor and its successors and assigns, and is fully assignable by El Pollo Loco.\n\n8.2. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is personal in nature with respect to Developer, being entered into by Franchisor in reliance upon and in consideration of the personal skills, qualifications and trust and confidence reposed in Developer and Developer's present partners, managing members or officers if Developer is a partnership, a limited liability company or a corporation. Therefore, the rights, privileges and interests of Developer under this Agreement shall not be assigned, sold, transferred, leased, divided or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of El Pollo Loco, which consent may be given or withheld as El Pollo Loco's sole and absolute right. For purposes of this Section, a sale of stock, or any membership or partnership interest in Developer, or a merger or other combination of Developer shall be considered a transfer of Developer's interest prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall be permitted to assign business organizations to serve as Franchisee after Developer individually executes the Franchise Agreements, provided the ownership mirrors that of Developer (e.g., Developer consists of persons A (50%), B (25%) and C (25%). Franchisee also must be owned and controlled by the same three (3) persons with each retaining the same percentage of ownership). All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor. Developer shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per transfer for each permitted transfer to an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of principals of the business. Where Developer desires to add new principals to the Developer or any Franchisee entity, Developer shall pay to Franchisor an additional Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) per new principal to cover Franchisor's administrative costs for reviewing the application and suitability of each new principal as participants in the franchise business.\n\n9.

Covenant Not to Compete.\n\n20.1. To further protect the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System while this Agreement is in effect, Developer and each officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, partner and other equity owner, as applicable, of Developer, if Developer is an entity, shall neither directly nor indirectly own, operate, control or any financial interest in any other business which would constitute a \"Competitive Business\" (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written consent of Franchisor; provided further, that Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right, consent to the Developer's continued operation of any business already in existence and operating at the time of execution of this Agreement. In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory. The foregoing shall not apply to operation of an El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurant by Developer pursuant to a Franchise Agreement with Franchisor or the ownership by Developer of less than five percent (5%) of the issued or outstanding stock of any company whose shares are listed for trading on any public exchange or on the over-the-counter market, provided that Developer does not control or become involved in the operations of any such company. For purposes of this Section 20.1, a Competitive Business shall mean a self-service restaurant or fast-food business which sells chicken and/or Mexican food products, which products individually or collectively represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues from such self-service restaurant or fast-food business operated at any one location during any calendar quarter.

In the event that any provision of Section 20.1 above shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Agreement shall not be void, but such provision shall be limited to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\n\n20.3. Developer understands and acknowledges that Franchisor shall have the right to reduce the scope of any obligation imposed on Developer by Section 20.1, without Developer's consent, and that such modified provision shall be effective upon Developer's receipt of written notice thereof.\n\n20.4. Developer acknowledges that violation of the covenants not to compete contained in this Agreement would result in immediate and irreparable injury to Franchisor for which no adequate remedy at law will be available. Accordingly, Developer hereby consents to the entry of a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting any conduct by Developer in violation of the terms of those covenants not to compete set forth in this Agreement.
