All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below).   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the Provider and the Company entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") by and between the Provider and the Company dated as of April 7, 2003;   WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Provider will transfer the Fiber Ring Assets to the Company upon the Closing;   WHEREAS, as a condition to the Closing, the Provider and the Company agreed to enter into this Agreement;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:   SECTION 1 TERM OF AGREEMENT   1.1. Initial Term. This Agreement commences on the date first above written, and will remain in effect for the period of five (5) years, except as otherwise provided herein.   1.2. Extension of Term. This Agreement will extend automatically for monthly periods unless either party to this Agreement notifies the other party in writing at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the then current term.   1.3 Termination of Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without liability by providing one hundred eighty (180) days written notice to the other party.   SECTION 2  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND FEES   2.1. Services.   (a) The Provider or its affiliate will provide the Company, with respect to the Fiber Ring Assets, all maintenance services (including but not limited to jetwashing and related ancillary services) required under the Provider's license agreements with the municipalities in which the Fiber Ring Assets are located (each a \"City Rights Agreement\"), and monitoring, emergency response and emergency splicing (collectively, the \"Services\"). If a\n\n\n\n\n\n  service call is required to restore the Fiber Ring Assets to good operating condition, the Company will notify the Provider promptly after it becomes aware of the service affecting problem.   (b) The Services shall not include any of the following:   (i) remedial or preventive maintenance service performed outside that expressly defined in this Section 2.1;   (ii) repair of damage or loss resulting from accident, neglect, misuse or abuse or causes other than ordinary use by the Company for the purpose for which any of the Fiber Ring Assets was designed (collectively, \"Repairs\"); provided that Services do include Repairs if the damage or loss is caused by the Provider;   (iii) making specification or field engineering changes;   (iv) unless authorized in writing by the Provider, services resulting from, or which are impractical for the Provider to render because of, any adjustment, repair, maintenance, modification or alteration of the Fiber Ring Assets by any person other than the Provider; and   (v) service calls required to restore any of the Fiber Ring Assets to good operating condition, if the Company fails to notify the Provider of a need for service within one (1) day of the Company's knowledge of such need, and such delay has made the provision of the Services more costly.   2.2. Availability of the Services and Repairs. The Provider will be available to provide the Services 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week. Periodically during the term of this Agreement, the Provider will provide to the Company contact information and reasonable protocols to be followed in order to schedule performance of the Services.   2.3. Fees. In each of the first twelve months of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Provider $40,000 per month in exchange for the Services (the \"Service Fee\"). Upon each anniversary of the commencement of this Agreement, the Service Fee shall be increased by a percentage that reflects the actual increases in the Provider's cost of providing the Services, if any. All materials and labor required to provide any Repairs or any other services or other work not specified in Section 2.1(a) hereof requested by the Company shall be billed to the Company, in addition to the Service Fee as adjusted, at a rate equal to the Provider's actual cost plus 10% service/overhead fee.

In any sale of a fiber ring, any transferee must agree to assume these obligations from Buyer.   3.3. Transfer of the Fiber Ring Assets. The Company shall not sell, transfer or otherwise attempt to convey or dispose of any part of the Fiber Ring Assets, other than sales and leases of capacity or of individual fiber strands in the ordinary and usual course of business unless the Provider consents to such transaction, which consent will not be withheld if, (a) the proposed transferee consents in writing to the assumption of all obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including those obligations to be undertaken under other agreements pursuant to Section 3.3, and (b) all governmental approvals (under City Rights Agreements or otherwise) have been obtained, with the Provider having the right (if it elects) to coordinate such efforts if it is the counterparty under such agreements requiring approval (with the Company to pay the reasonable costs of doing so).
