The Parties agree that the territory of such engagement shall be worldwide (the \"Territory\").\n\n2. Term of Agreement. The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of four (4) years, commencing on the Effective Date, which term may be extended for up to three (3) years by written agreement of both Parties prior to the expiration date of the initial term or any extension thereof (collectively, the \"Term\"). Each twelve-month period beginning on the Effective Date shall be known as a \"Contract Year.\" In the event that either Wade or Naked wishes to extend the Term of the Agreement as contemplated above, it shall provide the other Party with written notice at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term. The other Party will then have a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wade agrees that for a period of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term (unless the Agreement is terminated by Wade as permitted hereunder), Naked shall have the exclusive right to negotiate for continued endorsement by Athlete of the Naked Products. For a period of six (6) months at the end of the Term (the \"Sell-off Period\"); provided that the Agreement was not terminated by Wade as permitted herein, Naked will have the right to continue to sell the Wade Products (defined below) for which orders have already been placed at the end of the Term on the terms and conditions herein.\n\n3.

Naked agrees to submit to Wade or its authorized agent a copy of all new promotional and/or advertising material using Wade Image at least ten (10) days prior to the release to the general public. Wade and its authorized agent agree that they shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade's or  authorized agent's receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved. Any such usage featuring Athlete shall be and remain the property of Naked except as otherwise set forth herein; however, Naked shall have the right to such use only during the Term. Wade may use said materials in whole or in part for Wade's personal portfolio, website or otherwise. Such usage may not be sold or transferred. For the avoidance of doubt, that certain logo designed by Athlete prior to the date hereof (the \"Logo\") shall remain the sole property of Wade and Naked shall have license during the Term to use the Logo for the advertising, endorsement, promotion, or sale of the Naked Products (including the Wade Products) in the Territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

Furthermore, Wade will not engage in any business or other transaction or have any financial or personal interest in any entity whose primary or core business is selling or  manufacturing Innerwear during the Term.

The scheduling and content of said production days shall be mutually determined by Wade and Naked, subject to Wade's professional availability;\n\nB. Beginning in the second Contract Year, Wade will be available for a maximum of one (1) production day for creating marketing assets for Wade Products and Naked Products for unlimited use in advertisements and the media, for a maximum of three (3) consecutive hours, not including scheduled breaks, during such production day period.

Naked has the right to request such removals at any time, even if Naked previously approved the Independent Promotions, and Naked agrees that all social media promotions it requests of Athlete shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations. Naked may also provide material regarding the Naked Products and Wade Products to Wade, and Wade agrees to include such materials in his Independent Promotions; and\n\n3\n\nSource: NAKED BRAND GROUP INC., POS AM (on S-1), 7/31/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information has been omitted in places marked \"[***]\" and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Naked may also propose to use the Commercial Materials as part of cooperative advertising and retail tie in promotions  subject to Wade's prior written approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that withholding approval because a potential tie in conflicts with one of Athlete's existing sponsors shall not be deemed  unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no case shall the Commercial Materials feature any commercial tie in or other use that could be perceived as an endorsement by Athlete of any products or services other than the Naked Products. Naked shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations  (including the NBA's) in its use of the Commercial Materials hereunder.\n\n7. Design of Wade Products.\n\nNaked and Wade (either Athlete or a team and/or agent and/or designer designated by Athlete, referred to as the \"Wade Team\") agree to collaborate on the design and manufacture of a new line of Innerwear under the brand \"Wade By Naked\" or such other brand name as the Parties agree (collectively, the \"Wade Products\").
