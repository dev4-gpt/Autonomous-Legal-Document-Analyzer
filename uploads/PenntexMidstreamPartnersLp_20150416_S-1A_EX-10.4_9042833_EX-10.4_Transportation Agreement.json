Transporter shall allocate Customer's pro rata share of each NGL Component contained in any commingled stream of Gas at any Point(s) of Delivery based on the GPMs of each NGL Component contained in Customer's Gas as measured by chromatograph or other method acceptable in the industry at the Point(s) of Receipt.\n\nImbalances. The term \"Imbalance\" means the cumulative difference in a Month between: (i) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu received for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Receipt, less Customer's System Fuel & LUAF quantity, as applicable, and (ii) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu delivered for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Delivery. After any adjustment for System Fuel & LUAF, if the Imbalance is the result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt exceeding the delivered (or scheduled, as applicable) quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a \"Positive Imbalance\". If the Imbalance is a result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt being lower than the delivered quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a \"Negative Imbalance\". Imbalances will be cashed out on a Monthly basis.   8\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Out. The cash-out settlement price will be the monthly arithmetical average of the prices (\"Cash-out Price\") as posted in Gas Daily's Daily Price Survey during the Month under the heading \"Texas Gas Transmission Corp.,\" under the column labeled \"Index\" corresponding to the row labeled \"Zone 1.\" Transporter will pay Customer an amount that is the product of the Positive Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. Customer will pay Transporter an amount that is the product of the Negative Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. If the actual monthly volume varies by more than five percent (5%) from the delivered volumes for the Month, then the Cash-out Price will be adjusted as follows:\n\n\n\n1. For Negative Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be increased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% less than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%; and\n\n\n\n2. For Positive Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be decreased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% greater than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%.\n\nArticle V. Curtailment\n\nIf the quantity of Customer Gas and all other Gas available for delivery into the Transportation System exceeds the capacity of the Transportation System at any point, then Transporter shall interrupt or curtail receipts of Customer Gas with respect to the affected point(s) only in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) First, Transporter shall curtail all Interruptible Service Gas prior to curtailing Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Interruptible Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System available for Interruptible Service Gas at the affected points on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Interruptible Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Interruptible Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\n(b) Second, if additional curtailments are required beyond those described in the immediately preceding clause (a), Transporter shall curtail Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Firm Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System at the affected point(s) on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Firm Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Firm Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\nTransporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nArticle VI. Measurement & Testing\n\nThe construction, ownership, installation, operation and maintenance of each Measurement Facility that is owned by a Person other than Transporter shall be governed by an interconnect agreement between Transporter and such Person. Each other Measurement Facility shall be constructed, installed, owned, operated and maintained by Transporter.   9\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle VII. Gas Quality\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Customer Gas received at a Point of Receipt from one of the Plants shall be deemed to be in compliance with the applicable Gas quality specifications of the Transportation System.\n\nArticle VIII. Fees, Billing & Payment\n\nFees.\n\n(a) Transportation Fee. For all Customer Gas received by Transporter at a Point of Receipt and delivered to any Point of Delivery, Customer shall pay Transporter a transportation fee of $0.04 per MMBtu.\n\n(b) Other Services Fees. If Transporter provides any compression Services with respect to Customer Gas delivered hereunder, the fees applicable to such Services shall be as mutually agreed between the Parties. The Parties agree to supplement this Agreement with an addendum or other mutually agreeable modification to memorialize the terms applicable to the provision of any such additional Services.\n\nInvoices and Statements. On or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar Day of each Month, Transporter shall provide to Customer an invoice and statement for the previous Month setting forth the calculation of the net amount due hereunder to Transporter for the Services provided hereunder during such previous Month.\n\nPayment of Statements. Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.   10\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nBilling Disputes. If a good faith dispute arises as to any amount payable hereunder, payment shall nevertheless be made when due of the amount not in dispute. Such payment shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to recoup any overpayment. If Customer withholds payment of any disputed amount, Customer shall, within seven (7) calendar Days after receipt of the statement for the month to which the disputed amount pertains, submit to Transporter a written explanation of the dispute and any available supporting documentation. The Parties shall then cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as expeditiously as possible.\n\nAudit Rights.

Each Party agrees to keep its records and books in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the oil and gas industry. Each invoice and statement shall be final as to both Parties unless questioned in writing within twenty four (24) Months following the date of such invoice or statement.\n\nArticle IX.

Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Transporter from and against any and all claims and losses arising out of or related to such Taxes or surcharges. This indemnity and defense obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

Transporter acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.\n\nShould Customer or its guarantor fail to provide Performance Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Transporter shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Customer furnishes Performance Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Transporter shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.   14\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nIf during the Term, if Transporter has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Transporter, Customer shall have the right to request and receive from Transporter adequate Performance Assurance under similar terms and conditions as described above, including the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Transporter furnishes Performance Assurance.\n\nArticle XV.
