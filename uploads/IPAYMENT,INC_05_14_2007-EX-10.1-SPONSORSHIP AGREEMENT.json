If ISO desires to use the services of an individual independent contractor who represents himself or herself as working for ISO using ISO's legal/business name (\"IC\"), then ISO shall enter into a written agreement with each such IC that (i) requires the IC to comply with all applicable terms of this Agreement and all applicable Rules, laws and regulations, and (ii) prohibits the making of any representation or creating any liability on behalf of SERVICERS.\n\n  (b)   ISO's currently utilizes the Other MSP's and IC's listed on Exhibit E attached hereto in its Merchant processing business. The parties agree to work together expeditiously and in good faith to transfer the registration or re-register all such entities with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules. All Other MSP's must be appropriately registered before boarding accounts under Bank's sponsorship.\n\n2.5  SERVICERS' Obligations.\n\n  (a)   Bank will sponsor ISO, at ISO's expense, as an ISO for Visa, as an MSP for MasterCard and, to the extent applicable, as similarly required for all other Bank Card associations and, to the extent required by any Bank Card association, Bank also agrees to sponsor for registration with Visa and/or MasterCard those Other MSP's, IC's, subsidiaries and marketing representatives of ISO which are approved by SERVICERS. Unless otherwise disallowed by a Bank Card association, Bank agrees to maintain such sponsorships throughout the term of this Agreement and until the first of either to occur: (i) [***] days after the\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request.

Bank will forward to ISO all information routinely provided by each Bank Card association that is not otherwise available to ISO that are allowed to be shared with ISO under the Rules that would be helpful to ISO in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n  (d)   Bank will maintain all cardholder information under its control and/or possession in a safe and secure manner in compliance with the Rules, and will report to Bank Card associations as required by the Rules relating to internal policies and procedures related to cardholder information security. Furthermore, Bank agrees to inform the ISO immediately regarding any breach of information security that may have an adverse effect to the ISO or to its Merchants.\n\n  (e)   Bank, as the acquiring principal member, agrees to represent ISO's interest in disputes that might arise from time to time with a Bank Card association over compliance with Rules and fines; provided, however, that ISO shall pay any fines or other charges imposed on Bank by a Bank Card association relating to the Merchant Program and any and all costs reasonably incurred by Bank in disputing the same, including reasonable associated legal fees.\n\n  (f)   FDMS has entered into an agreement with FFB, pursuant to which FFB will sponsor (or assume the sponsorship of) Merchants, FDMS and its customers, including ISO, into certain networks (\"Debit Sponsorship\"). ISO agrees to the additional terms and conditions relating specifically to the Debit Sponsorship, as set forth in Exhibit G.\n\nSECTION 3 MARKETING AND COMPLIANCE\n\n3.1  Application Materials.

ISO and ISO's Other MSP's and IC's will not use SERVICERS' or SERVICERS' Affiliates' Marks in any advertising, promotional or display materials without SERVICERS' prior written approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond fifteen (15) days.\n\nSECTION 4 APPLICATION AND UNDERWRITING PROCEDURES\n\n4.1  Applications. ISO shall solicit Applications from Eligible Merchants at ISO's sole expense and shall provide each Applicant with Application Materials. ISO shall collect completed and signed Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and shall forward them to SERVICERS within [***] [***] Business Days after the merchant is boarded (which may be accessed by SERVICERS online or forwarded to SERVICERS via ISO's automated application system or to a facsimile number designated by SERVICERS, provided such complies with the Rules and applicable laws, rules and regulations) or to any other place(s) as SERVICERS may designate for processing and document storage. ISO shall retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO shall provide SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system (BAMS, or any such successor or replacement system) at no cost to SERVICERS.\n\n4.2  Underwriting. ISO shall underwrite, perform a credit review and conduct a site inspection, when applicable, for each Application as required by this Agreement, the Merchant Processing Policy and the Rules to determine whether each Applicant is an Eligible Merchant. ISO may conduct such credit review without notification to and participation by SERVICERS, except as otherwise provided below (i.e., for any\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    prospective Merchant that falls within the risk and volume parameters set forth in this Section 4.2), provided that ISO performs the credit review in accordance with the Merchant Processing Policy, the terms of this Agreement and the Rules. In accordance with and as permitted by this Agreement, a third-party service provider approved by SERVICERS may perform site inspections for ISO. In order to assist ISO in its underwriting hereunder, SERVICERS shall assist ISO with checking Merchants and prospective Merchants against the Terminated Merchant File/MATCH List or any similar list maintained by any entity. ISO shall be responsible for all credit and fraud losses associated with the Merchant Portfolio or the Program, regardless of any services or assistance that may be provided by SERVICERS. For any high risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***] and any low risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***], ISO shall advise SERVICERS and permit SERVICERS to conduct their own credit review prior to boarding the account. Upon receipt of a complete underwriting package from ISO, SERVICERS will respond to ISO within [***] [***] Business Days as to SERVICERS' acceptance or rejection of such Merchant. SERVICERS' participation in any credit review will not in any way relieve ISO from its responsibility for credit and fraud losses which may result from a Merchant's transaction processing. SERVICERS may at any time require that a Merchant relationship be terminated by ISO and Bank may cease the provision of services to any such Merchant pursuant to the terms of the Merchant Processing Agreement. SERVICERS shall have the right and authority to accept or reject any Application. ISO shall obtain prospective Merchants' authorization for ISO and/or SERVICERS to obtain all reports (including personal and business credit reports) and other information necessary in connection with the Application. ISO shall have the right, subject to and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merchant Processing Policy, to cause any Eligible Merchant with transaction card volume processing limits up to but not more than $[***] per month, that has been approved by ISO, to be activated immediately in SERVICES' systems. SERVICERS agree to provide ISO with a final approval decision (i.e., acceptance, rejection or required modification of the submitted Application) on submitted and complete Merchant Applications for Eligible Merchants that are not classified as \"high risk\" on the High Risk Merchant List attached hereto as Exhibit F and which seek approval for transaction card volume processing limits in excess of $[***] per month but not more than $[***] per month, within [***] [***] Business Days after SERVICERS' receipt of such completed Merchant Application and documentation.\n\n4.3  Credit Decisions. ISO shall employ the Merchant Processing Policy guidelines provided by SERVICERS in making credit evaluations. SERVICERS reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to:\n\n  (a)   Change the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (b)   Reject the Application of any Applicant who SERVICERS determine does not satisfy SERVICERS' Merchant Processing Policy; and\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c)   Terminate the Merchant Processing Agreement with respect to any Merchant at any time, according to the Merchant Processing Agreement terms.\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as all of the following are true with respect to a Merchant or Merchant Account, SERVICERS agree that, except as required by the Rules, SERVICERS shall neither terminate nor make any change with respect to the discount or reserve of said Merchant or Merchant Account that will have an adverse effect on the Merchant or Merchant Account without the prior written consent of ISO:\n\n  (i)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not in a Bank Card association monitoring program;\n\n  (ii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not engaged in, or aiding and abetting, any illegal activity or fraud;\n\n  (iii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is in compliance with the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (iv)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not processing transactions where products are delivered or services rendered more than one (1) year (on the average, based upon transactions of the immediately preceding three (3) months) following the date of the transaction;\n\n  (v)   No Bank Card association nor any regulatory agency has requested that the Merchant or Merchant Account be terminated;\n\n  (vi)   In its sole judgment, SERVICERS do not feel that they may be at financial risk as a result of the activity of a Merchant or Merchant Account; and\n\n  (vii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not causing reputational harm or risk to either of SERVICERS in their reasonable judgment.\n\nIn the event SERVICERS decide to terminate or make any such adverse change with respect to a Merchant or Merchant Account, SERVICERS shall first attempt to give ISO notice of SERVICERS' decision.\n\n4.4  Merchant Reserve Accounts. ISO shall be responsible for determining the amount of any Merchant Reserve Accounts. ISO shall also be responsible for ensuring all Merchant Reserve Accounts are adequately funded. All Merchant Reserve Accounts, along with any other monies or collateral collected from Approved Merchants, shall be deposited with Bank. [***] ISO will monitor daily Merchant account activity and if in ISO's reasonable judgment certain Approved Merchants and/or certain transactions are possibly fraudulent or otherwise not in\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    compliance with the Rules or in violation of the Merchant Processing Agreement, ISO will instruct SERVICERS to change the Merchant bank account information to cause funds otherwise due such Merchant to be diverted and deposited into the Merchant Reserve Account for such Merchant. ISO will thereafter promptly investigate each such suspicious incident and, upon request, promptly notify SERVICERS of the result of any such investigation. If in any case ISO's investigation determines that no violation occurred, ISO will promptly request SERVICERS to release any funds diverted to the Merchant Reserve Account to the Merchant's deposit account. Once monies or other collateral are deposited in a Merchant Reserve Account, SERVICERS shall control the disbursements of such funds which are to be (a) paid to ISO or SERVICERS to cover losses incurred in connection with the applicable Approved Merchant or (b) returned to the applicable Approved Merchant upon a reduction in the potential risk to ISO and SERVICERS arising from the provision of services to such Merchant within two (2) Business Days after receipt of a written request by ISO. From time to time, ISO may request SERVICERS to disburse monies held in a Merchant Reserve Account to ISO or an Approved Merchant as set forth in the preceding sentence, and SERVICERS shall consider such requests in good faith. Bank may draw against any Merchant Reserve Account to cover any Losses or credit and fraud losses incurred by SERVICERS with respect to an Approved Merchant without the consent of ISO or the applicable Approved Merchant.\n\n4.5  Maintenance of Underwriting Staff. ISO shall at all times maintain an adequate and qualified staff to perform underwriting and credit reviews of Program Merchants.\n\nSECTION 5 PROPRIETARY RIGHTS\n\n5.1  General. To the extent required by the Rules, legal title to all Merchant Applications, Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts and records shall be in the name of Bank, subject to its obligations to effect a Program Transfer pursuant to Section 10.4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that Bank acknowledges and agrees that ISO shall own and maintain the Merchant relationship during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. ISO acknowledges and agrees that all Merchant Applications, Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts and records may not be transferred, assigned, sold or exchanged by ISO except as set forth in this Agreement or the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement. Bank shall be exclusively responsible and entitled to receive all payments, collections, and other amounts due from Merchants, subject to its payment obligations to ISO. Each of ISO's and Bank's rights shall survive the termination of this Agreement by either party and for whatever cause.

ISO agrees that the initial amount of the Offset Account will be $[***] and, thereafter, the Offset Account will, at all times, maintain collected funds in an amount at least equal to the amount then due SERVICERS hereunder (which shall be referred to herein as the \"Minimum Balance\").\n\n  (b)   If the collected funds on deposit in the Offset Account at any point in time are less than the Minimum Balance, SERVICERS may fund the Offset Account with any monies or funds belonging or payable to ISO which are in SERVICERS' possession. SERVICERS will promptly notify ISO after making any such transfer.\n\n  (c)   ISO hereby grants SERVICERS a security interest in the Offset Account to secure all of ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement.\n\n6.2  Settlement Procedures.\n\n  (a)   SERVICERS shall settle each Merchant Account in accordance with the terms of the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement, remitting to each Approved Merchant, by ACH or other acceptable method, all settled funds due to the Approved Merchant after first deducting from such settled funds all applicable Program Participation Fees and any other amounts owed or withheld under the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement. Merchant Account settlement is included in the fees set forth in Exhibit A and will not incur an additional fee.\n\n  (b)   On each Payment Date, SERVICERS shall credit ISO's Residual Account in an amount equal to all Net Program Participation Fees collected by SERVICERS since the immediately preceding Payment Date and which have not otherwise been paid to ISO.\n\n  (c)   In the event that the Net Program Participation Fees are insufficient to pay any amounts due to SERVICERS' under this Agreement (including compensation, funding the Offset Account, funding the Reserve Account, or paying third party processing fees), then ISO shall provide sufficient additional funds to SERVICERS upon demand.\n\n  (d)   [***]\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      [***]\n\n6.3  Payment Deferrals. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under this Agreement or applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, SERVICERS are hereby authorized by ISO, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand to ISO or to any other person (any such notice and demand being hereby expressly waived), to setoff, recoup and to appropriate and to apply any and all monies or funds belonging or payable to ISO which are in Bank's possession against and on account of ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement (including funding the Offset Account, the Reserve Account, the Termination Reserve Account or funding chargebacks), whether such obligations are liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured.\n\n6.4  Expenses. Except as otherwise provided, each party shall bear its own administrative costs and overhead expenses arising out of its performance of this Agreement.\n\n6.5  Liability for Losses. Unless any Losses are caused by SERVICERS or are attributable to the negligence or willful misconduct of SERVICERS, SERVICERS shall have recourse from ISO, and ISO shall fully reimburse SERVICERS, for any Losses to SERVICERS that are caused by:\n\n  (a)   Chargebacks, purchase returns, refunds, credits, adjustments, fees or Bank Card association fines, costs and expenses related to Approved Merchants, Eligible Merchants, or any Merchant activity hereunder; and\n\n  (b)   Amounts remaining due to SERVICERS after the deduction of SERVICERS' compensation as provided herein.\n\n6.6  Bank Card Association Assessments/Fees. ISO shall pay or fund when due all Bank Card association assessments/fees, including any and all quarterly assessments/fees.\n\n6.7  Survival. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8  Assignment of Merchant Losses. SERVICERS agree that after SERVICERS have been fully reimbursed by ISO for a Merchant loss pursuant to this Agreement, and provided that the Merchant Account resulting in the Merchant loss has been terminated, that SERVICERS will, at the request of ISO, assign to ISO any and all of SERVICERS' subrogation rights under or related to the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise) related to the indebtedness of such Merchant under the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise), so that ISO may pursue collection recovery activities in connection with such Merchant loss. Any such collection recovery activities shall be conducted in the name of ISO and shall be subject to the indemnification obligations of ISO. Bank agrees to execute and deliver to ISO such assignment documents as reasonably requested and required by ISO to vest such collection loss(es) recovery right to ISO and as reasonably required in connection with such collection recovery activities.\n\nSECTION 7 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ISO\n\n    ISO represents and warrants to SERVICERS that, as of the date of this Agreement, the following are true and correct:\n\n7.1  Organization and Good Standing.

Except for filings, consents, waivers, approvals, and authorizations that the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material adverse effect on ISO or the Program, no filing, consent, waiver, approval, or authorization of any governmental authority or of any third party other than Visa and MasterCard, or notice to, or filing with, any governmental authority or any third party on the part of ISO is required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the conduct of the activities contemplated hereby.\n\n7.5  Litigation.

The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c)   If ISO's funds in the Reserve Account are not sufficient to cover the chargebacks, adjustments, fees and other charges due to SERVICERS from ISO or Merchants, or if the funds in the Reserve Account have been released, ISO agrees to pay SERVICERS such sums within five (5) Business Days of any such request by SERVICERS. In the event of a failure by ISO to fund the Reserve Account, SERVICERS may fund such Reserve Account in any of the manners set forth above.\n\n  (d)   To secure ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement, ISO grants to SERVICERS a lien and security interest in and to any of ISO's funds in the Reserve Account or otherwise related to this Agreement now or hereafter in the possession of SERVICERS, whether now or hereafter due or to become due to ISO from SERVICERS.

Each party also shall take the action as the other may, from time to time, reasonably request in order that the purposes of this Agreement will be fully accomplished and that all matters contemplated hereby will comply with all Rules or other applicable statutory, regulatory or other legal requirements. ISO shall promptly deliver to SERVICERS after receipt by ISO a copy of all non-routine notices or correspondence that it receives from MasterCard, Visa, or other networks or Bank Card associations, or any other third party, which in any way relates to any Merchant's or ISO's participation in MasterCard, Visa, and other networks or Bank Card associations under this Agreement.\n\n8.4  Compliance With Rules. ISO also covenants to the following:\n\n  (a)   ISO will obtain copies of all available Rules from Visa and MasterCard and any other Bank Card association that makes its Rules available to ISOs.

ISO also agrees not to suggest, imply or in any manner create an impression that it is a Member or an authorized representative of Visa and/or MasterCard or that it is other than an independent sales organization or member service provider for a Member. Further, ISO may not create an impression that Visa and/or MasterCard in any way endorses ISO or the Program it coordinates through SERVICERS.\n\n  (g)   ISO may use one or more of Visa's or MasterCard's marks under the following conditions:\n\n  (i)   The marks are used in accordance with the Rules; and\n\n  (ii)   The marks are used pursuant to the express written permission of Bank.\n\n  (h)   Except as expressly set forth herein, ISO may not subcontract, sublicense, assign, license, franchise or in any other manner extend or transfer to any third party any right or obligation ISO may have in connection with the Program.

ISO and each Other MSP shall at all times, at ISO's and/or each Other MSP's cost and expense, maintain in effect during the term of this Agreement, a valid and effective registration as an independent service organization with Visa and a member service provider with MasterCard and shall provide any information as Visa and MasterCard may reasonably request in connection therewith or in connection with the services of ISO hereunder, and shall provide SERVICERS the information as it may reasonably request concerning compliance with all applicable Rules, laws, regulations and the requirements set forth herein in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto will work together expeditiously and in good faith to register and maintain the registration of ISO and each Other MSP with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules.\n\n8.6   Mark Restriction.

ISO shall make available (whether through public filings or directly) SERVICERS with annual audited financial statements prepared by an independent auditing firm within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year (and shall make available to SERVICERS quarterly financial statements upon request of SERVICERS). In addition, ISO will provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information as required by the Rules. ISO will, at any and all reasonable times, permit SERVICERS' employees, agents and/or auditors to inspect ISO's books and records at SERVICERS' expense prior request and notice and if for a particular need.\n\nSECTION 9 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n9.1   Confidential Information. Confidential Information is non-public and proprietary information relating to the business of ISO or its Affiliates that SERVICERS and their Affiliates acquire during the term of this Agreement, and information relating to the business of SERVICERS and their Affiliates. It includes, but is not limited to, the following, whether used in, or to be used in, the business of ISO or SERVICERS: physical systems for the operation of the business; all present and planned strategies, business plans, and projections; all market and sales and marketing information; all\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    financial, accounting, and credit information; and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither party will disclose, furnish, sell, convey, or use for any purpose other than as contemplated under this Agreement any of the other parties' Confidential Information or materials without written authorization. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that all Merchant information is the Confidential Information of ISO and (i) may not be used by SERVICERS for any purpose other than to provide the services contemplated hereunder during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, and (ii) will not be used by SERVICERS, directly or indirectly, to solicit any Merchants in the Merchant Portfolio.\n\n9.2   Exclusions. Nothing in this Section 9 shall restrict either party with respect to Confidential Information which: (a) the receiving party can demonstrate was rightfully possessed by it before it received the information from the disclosing party; (b) was in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement or subsequently becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party or any person acting on its behalf; (c) was previously received by the receiving party from a third party or is subsequently furnished rightfully to the receiving party by a third party not known to be under restrictions on use or disclosure; (d) is independently developed by such party; (e) is required to be disclosed by the Rules, law, regulation or court order, provided that the disclosing party will exercise reasonable efforts to notify the other party prior to disclosure; or (f) is required to be disclosed to comply with or to enforce the terms of this Agreement.\n\n9.3   Ownership of Work Product.

Upon termination of the Agreement, each party shall immediately cease using any materials using the other's Marks or Intellectual Property, and shall immediately destroy all such materials.\n\n9.4   Remedy; Survival. If any party breaches this Section 9, the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable harm and the total amount of monetary damages for any injury to such party will be impossible to calculate and therefore an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching party may (i) seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief against the breaching party or (ii) exercise any other rights and seek any other remedies to which the non-breaching party may be entitled to at law, in equity and under this Agreement for any violation of this Section 9. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 10 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n10.1  Initial Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be four (4) Processing Years commencing on the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending on June 30, 2010 unless\n\nPage 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    terminated earlier as provided in this Section 10.

SERVICERS may terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration for cause upon prior written notice to ISO as follows:\n\n  (a)   Upon a Material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement by ISO which is not cured by ISO within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS; provided however, that if ISO is attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then ISO shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (b)   Upon a breach of any Material Rule by ISO, or repeated breach of any Rule by ISO which is not cured by ISO within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS; provided however, that if ISO is attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then ISO shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (c)   Upon any commission of any fraudulent activity by ISO, or the illegal activity of ISO's employees in the performance of their duties in connection with this Agreement;\n\n  (d)   Upon any failure by ISO to pay (or make arrangements to pay that are acceptable to SERVICERS) any amount due under this Agreement to SERVICERS which does not give rise to the right to terminate under any other provision of this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after written notice to ISO of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (e)   Upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of ISO;\n\n  (f)   Upon a Material adverse change in the business or financial condition of ISO;\n\n  (g)   Upon an assignment of this Agreement by ISO without SERVICERS' prior written consent;\n\n  (h)   Upon the failure by ISO to maintain good standing as an \"independent sales organization\" with Visa or a \"member services provider\" with MasterCard;\n\n  (i)   If SERVICERS are required by a governmental or regulatory body or agency or by any Bank Card association to terminate the Services on behalf of ISO with as much prior notice as is practicable under the circumstances;\n\nPage 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (j)   If ISO fails to fund the Offset Account or the Reserve Account as required under this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after written notice to ISO of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (k)   Upon the termination of the Service Agreement for any reason with one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to ISO; or\n\n  (l)   Upon a Change of Control of ISO with one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to ISO, unless the SERVICERS had previously consented to such change in control.\n\n10.3  Termination by ISO. ISO may terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration for cause upon prior written notice to SERVICERS as follows:\n\n  (a)   Upon a Material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement by SERVICERS which is not cured by SERVICERS within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from ISO; provided however, that if SERVICES are attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then SERVICERS shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (b)   Upon any failure by SERVICERS to pay any amount due under this Agreement which does not give rise to the right to terminate under any other provision of this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after written notice to SERVICERS of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (c)   Upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of either of the SERVICERS;\n\n  (d)   Upon the termination of the Service Agreement for any reason;\n\n  (e)   Upon a Material adverse change in the business or financial condition of either of SERVICERS;\n\n  (f)   Upon an assignment of this Agreement by SERVICERS without ISO's prior written consent;\n\n  (g)   Upon the failure by SERVICERS to maintain good standing with Visa or a MasterCard;\n\n  (h)   If required by a governmental or regulatory body or agency or by any Bank Card association to terminate;\n\n  (i)   Upon cessation of Bank Card operations by SERVICERS; or\n\nPage 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (j)   At any time upon one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to the SERVICERS with no penalty.\n\n10.4  Effect of Termination.\n\n  (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, at the direction of ISO and pursuant to the plan of Deconversion, SERVICERS will transfer and assign all their interest in the Merchant Portfolio (including Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts) and the dedicated BINs/ICAs to a Visa and MasterCard Member designated by ISO, provided first that: (a) all amounts due (or estimated to become due) in connection with each Merchant Processing Agreement and under this Agreement have been paid to SERVICERS; (b) the Termination Reserve Account has been adequately funded; (c) ISO provides full written indemnities to SERVICERS regarding actual and potential losses or other obligations arising out of operation of the Program or arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or any Merchant Processing Agreement; and (d) the Program Transfer complies with all applicable Rules, laws and regulations (the \"Program Transfer\"). [***]\n\n  (b)   Until the completion of the Deconversion of the Merchant Portfolio, the parties shall continue to operate under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, ISO will promptly discontinue its promotion and recommendation of the Program and will cease to board new accounts on Bank's BINs and ICAs or for sponsorship by Bank. ISO will reimburse SERVICERS for any Deconversion pursuant to the plan for Deconversion, regardless of whether such Deconversion occurs before or after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. ISO shall continue to hold all risks associated with transactions processed by SERVICERS prior to the effective date of Deconversion of each respective Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio, including all risk relating to chargebacks and fraudulent transactions. ISO shall pay SERVICERS any amounts associated with such risks immediately upon demand.\n\n10.5  Termination Reserve Account. Within ten (10) Business Days of the issuing of a notice of termination by any party, ISO shall fund a Termination Reserve Account. Except as specifically set forth otherwise in this Section 10.5, all provisions of Section 8.1 of this Agreement with regard to the Reserve Account shall also apply to the Termination Reserve Account. The amount of the Termination Reserve Account shall be the greater of (i) the most recent required amount for the Reserve Account prior to termination, or (ii) the amount calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (a)   The amount of all chargebacks during the [***] [***] months preceding termination, plus\n\n  (b)   The amount of all assessed Bank Card association fines or penalties and all fees and contingent fees which are or shall become due to SERVICERS from ISO, plus\n\n  (c)   The estimated maximum amount of any known or likely significant loss events (defined as a credit or fraud loss that is likely to exceed $[***]).\n\n    Upon termination, any balance in the Reserve Account shall be transferred to, and be applied toward, the Termination Reserve Account. The Termination Reserve Account will be held by SERVICERS until the completion of the Program Transfer or for such longer period of time as is consistent with SERVICERS' liability for Bank Card transactions in accordance with the Rules. SERVICERS will reduce the Termination Reserve Account balance to reflect any reductions in ISO's then-potential liability as the Program Transfer and Deconversion progress.

General.\n\n  1.1.   ISO desires to deploy and service (or cause to be deployed and serviced), at merchant locations, terminals (\"POS Terminals\") that will be connected to the shared electronic funds transfer networks set forth on Schedule A to this Exhibit G, as it may be amended from time to time by FDMS in its sole discretion (the \"Debit Networks\"), to transmit point of sale transactions (\"POS Transactions\") generated by these POS Terminals through the Debit Networks' telecommunications and processing systems which effectuate the switching, processing and settlement of transactions (\"Debit Network Systems\"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"POS Services.\").\n\n  1.2.   ISO may offer qualified merchants the ability to provide, or have Customer provide on such merchant's behalf, merchants' ISOs with the option to pay their bills by initiating funds transfers through Debit Network Systems without PIN entry or verification, subject to additional terms and conditions agreed to by the ISO and FDMS (\"PIN-less Debit\"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"PIN-less Debit Services.\" The POS Services and PIN-less Debit Services, collectively, will be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"Debit Services\").\n\n  1.3.   Debit Networks require that in order for ISO to provide the POS Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a member of such Debit Network (\"Network Member\"). Certain Networks (\"Standard Networks\") require that in order for ISO to provide the PIN-less Debit Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a Network Member.\n\n2.  Duties of FDMS. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, FDMS agrees to cause FFB, a Network Member, to: (a) sponsor Merchants into Debit Networks for provision of POS Services; (b) sponsor Merchants into Standard Networks for provision of PIN-less Debit Services through Standard Networks, subject to additional terms agreed upon by FDMS and ISO; provided, that FFB, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to sponsor any Merchant and may terminate its sponsorship of a Merchant or direct ISO to refuse to provide or terminate its provision of Debit Services to a Merchant.\n\n  2.1.   Neither SERVICERS nor FFB will be responsible for the acts or omissions of any Debit Network or its agents or representatives.\n\n3.  Conflict with Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Exhibit G and the remainder of the Agreement as it relates to the subject matter hereof, the terms of this Exhibit G shall control. Otherwise, all terms and conditions of the remainder of the Agreement shall likewise apply to this Exhibit.\n\nExhibit G, Page 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule A\n\nDEBIT NETWORKS\n\n1.  All EDS networks, including; ACCEL, The Exchange, Instant Teller, Mpact, and TX.\n\n2.  Alaska Option\n\n3.  All Pulse networks, including; TYME, Money Station, and Gulfnet\n\n4.
