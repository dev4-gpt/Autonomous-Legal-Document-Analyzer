TERM; TERMINATION\n\n\n\nThe initial term of this Agreement shall be for 3 years (the \"Initial Term\") commencing on the date first set forth above (the \"Commencement Date\") and ending on the 3rd anniversary of the Commencement Date. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"), unless either Charterer or Owner elects not to renew this Agreement by providing the other party with written notice of such election 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, at which point this Agreement will automatically terminate.\n\n\n\nWithin 30 days of the end of the Initial Term, and within 30 days of the end of each Renewal Term, both parties hereto shall have the right renegotiate the fee specified below for the use of the vessels. If no such agreement on such fee is reached by such parties by the commencement of a Renewal Term, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.\n\n\n\nEither party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach by the other party of its obligations hereunder, subject to 10 days prior written notice of such breach given by the non-breaching party to the breaching party and the opportunity for such breaching party to cure such breach during such 10 day period.           Upon any such termination, this Agreement shall thereafter have no further force or effect except as to already accrued rights and obligations, which shall continue until satisfied.       2. GENERAL TERMS\n\n\n\nDuring the Term, Charterer agrees that Owner will be the sole and exclusive provider of marine transportation services for #2 fuel oil and high sulfur diesel owned by Charterer or owned by others and in transit for sale to Charterer so long as Owner has the required equipment available. Owner shall at all times provide sufficient and proper equipment for Charterer's performance of such transportation. Said equipment shall be manned, equipped, supplied and operated by Owner. The master and crew of said vessels shall be fully qualified, experience and, where necessary, certified and licensed. Owner agrees that said equipment shall be maintained in a seaworthy, staunch, tight and suitable condition and, to the best of Owner's knowledge, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nIn connection with its use of any vessel, Charterer will follow Owner's normal scheduling, loading and offloading protocols established from time to time, subject to Owner's obligations set forth in this Agreement.\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      3. RATE\n\n\n\nCharterer agrees to pay to Owner a fee of $______ per gallon of product transported. Owner will invoice such fees to Charterer on a monthly basis and Charterer will pay such invoiced amounts within 30 days of invoice date.\n\n\n\nThe fee stated above, unless otherwise adjusted by the parties pursuant to Section 1 above, shall be adjusted annually (both upward and downward), by a factor equal to the amount of increase or decrease, as the case may be, in the Consumer Price Index for the immediately proceeding month of November, over the Consumer Price Index for November of the preceding year. For purposes hereof, the term \"Consumer Price Index\" shall mean the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (1967=100)\" specified for \"All Items. United States\" compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor (the \"Index\"). In the event the Consumer Price Index shall be converted to a different standard reference base or otherwise revised, the determination of the percentage change shall be made with the use of such conversion factor, formula or table for converting the Consumer Price Index as may be published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or, if said Bureau shall not publish the same, then as shall be reasonably determined by the parties.       4. LOAD AND DISCHARGE\n\n\n\nThe Load Port shall be FOB Refinery Offtake in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Discharge Port shall be at the Owner's terminals located at Venice, LA; Port Forrochon, LA; Berwick, LA; Intracoastal City, LA; Cameron, LA; Sabine Pass, TX; Beaumont, TX; Galveston, TX; Houston, TX; Freeport, TX; Port O'Connor, TX; and Harbor Island, TX.       5.

The Charterer agrees not to tender for load any product injurious to the vessels or which product would render the vessels unfit, after cleaning, for the proper storage of similar product.       6. ASSIGNMENT   Neither party shall assign this Agreement without the express written consent of the other party.       7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\n\n\nThis Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement concerning the subject hereof between the parties superseding all previous agreements, negotiations and representations made prior or contemporaneous to the date hereof. This Agreement shall be modified or amended only by written agreement executed by both parties hereto.       8. GOVERNING LAW   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.       9.
