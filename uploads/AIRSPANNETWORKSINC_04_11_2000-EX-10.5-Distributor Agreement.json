Complete, unredacted copies of this exhibit have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of this Company's confidential treatment request.\n\nDistributor Agreement                              ---------------------\n\nThis Distributor Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made effective as of the 31st day of March, 2000 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between Airspan Networks Incorporated, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington having its principal office at 777 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1895, Bellevue, Washington 98004 (\"Airspan\") and GLS LLC, (\"Distributor\") a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the State of South Dakota having its principal office at 501 Fourth Street, Sergeant Bluff, IA 51054.\n\nWITNESSETH:\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan is engaged in the design and manufacture of various telecommunications product lines, including, among others, those product lines more completely described in Schedule I hereto (the product lines described in Schedule I, as from time to time amended in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, are hereinafter called the \"Airspan Products\") the hardware components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Equipment,\" the software components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Software\" as defined in Section 11.1, and an arrangement of Equipment which, when interfaced with Software, is operable to perform predetermined functions, is referred to as a \"System\");\n\nWHEREAS, Distributor is engaged in the promotion of sales of telecommunications products; and\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan desires to appoint Distributor as a Distributor for the Airspan Products for the territory described in Schedule II hereto (the \"Territory\").\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, it is hereby agreed as follows:\n\n1.   APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.\n\nDistributor hereby represents and warrants as follows:\n\na.   Distributor has been duly registered in accordance with any and all relevant legislation, has received any and all necessary governmental authorizations to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and that its entry into and performance under this Agreement will not violate applicable legislation;\n\nb.   Distributor is duly registered with all necessary tax authorities and is in compliance with all payment obligations in accordance with applicable legislation.  No claims against or investigations of Distributor with respect to its tax obligations exist;\n\nc.   Distributor is not currently involved in any litigation, arbitration, or other legal proceedings in which claims are being asserted against Distributor which might affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, nor is Distributor aware of any unasserted claims against Distributor of this nature; and\n\nd.   Distributor's bank accounts have been established and operated in accordance with applicable legislation.  All transactions of Distributor required to be carried out through authorized banks have been so carried out. Distributor is not, has not, and warrants that it will not breach any currency regulation or currency control legislation.

Distributor will conduct or provide for      any training of its personnel which may be necessary to impart such      knowledge.\n\n3.5  Distributor and its staff will research the technical requirements and      specifications of the market for Airspan Products in the Territory and make      information known to Airspan such that Airspan may, at its discretion,      implement appropriate technical changes to the Products to enable them to      be sold in the Territory. Airspan acknowledges that, subject to a further      and separate Agreement, such changes may be implemented in the future by      Distributor, with the assistance of Airspan.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 4\n\n3.6  Distributor agrees to purchase and stock a comprehensive inventory of      spare parts based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to      this Agreement.\n\n3.7  Distributor agrees to provide to its customers' installation services      for all Airspan Products.  All such installation services shall be      performed by Distributor in accordance with Airspan's latest installation      standards as provided by Airspan.\n\n3.8  Distributor agrees to train and have readily available a maintenance      staff to efficiently and expeditiously maintain or upgrade all Airspan      Products purchased or licensed by Distributor from Airspan.  Maintenance      shall be performed in accordance with Airspan's latest maintenance      standards for Airspan Products, as provided by Airspan, by Distributor's      own personnel and may not be subcontracted or delegated to any other person      or entity without Airspan's prior, written authorization.\n\n3.9  Distributor agrees to provide and maintain those facilities adequate      to meet the obligations set forth in this section and of the Agreement.      Distributor further agrees to provide all of the sales and support      functions set forth in this section at no charge to Airspan.\n\n3.10 Distributor agrees not to actively seek to promote, rent, lease, sell,      sublicense or authorize the rental, sale or sublicense of Airspan Products      outside of the Territory [without the prior written approval of Airspan],      but nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Distributor from renting,      selling or sublicensing the Airspan Products to customers outside of the      Territory in response to an unsolicited request from such customer.\n\n3.11 During the term of this Agreement Distributor agrees that neither it      nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without      Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of      products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature      as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products.\n\n3.12 The parties mutually agree that by April 30, 2000, the parties will      negotiate and execute a National Accounts Consulting Agreement whereby the      Distributor will receive consulting fees and commissions for the sale and      deployment of Airspan's products on a national basis. It is the intent of      the parties to jointly pursue the sale of products to said companies and to      enter into and complete contracts for the deployment of products in this      manner.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 5\n\n4.

Products      shall only be deemed similar if they provide like functionality.  The terms      and conditions shall only be deemed similar if the product is supplied      pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of similar duration and commitment,      provides for similar warranties and after service commitments, involves      similar spare part and support commitments, has the same payment and other      financial terms, and otherwise has similar terms and conditions.\n\n6.2  The Contract Price is shown in Schedule IV and shall include      applicable duties, taxes or imposts, including all export or import duties.      Sales taxes and contractor's excise taxes shall be itemized on all Purchase      Orders.  The parties agree that the Contract Price in Schedule IV shall be      firm for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) months from the Effective      Date. After the above period of twenty-four (24) months, Exhibit B may be      revised by Airspan giving thirty (30) days written notice to Distributor.\n\n7.  PAYMENT TERMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1  Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in      accordance with the payment terms below. The Invoice specifically will      identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract      Price of such items.  Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right      of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.\n\n7.2  If Distributor disputes any invoice or part thereof, Distributor      must notify Airspan in writing within twenty-five (25) days of the invoice      date giving details of the reason for such dispute.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 8\n\nDistributor and Airspan agree to work together in good faith to resolve the      dispute as quickly as possible. Distributor may withhold payment of such      disputed amounts until resolution of the dispute. Any parts of the invoice      not under dispute shall be paid net forty-five (45) days after the date of      invoice. On resolution of the dispute, Distributor shall immediately pay      any amounts due in full.\n\n7.3  Distributor will make payment by wire or telegraphic transfer to      the bank account set forth below or, on receipt of written notification      from Airspan, to another designated bank within the United States.\n\nBank:            Seafirst Bank, 10555 N.E. 8th, Bellevue, WA98004, USA.      Account name:    Airspan Networks Inc.      Account number:  68777507      Routing Number:  125 - 0000 - 24      Further instructions: \"Reference (Distributor's name), Purchase Order      number, Payment of Invoice number\"\n\nPayment will be deemed to have been made upon receipt of funds in Airspan's      bank.\n\n7.4  If the cost to Airspan of performing this Agreement increases as a      result of any change to the law or increase in import duty or freight duty,      Airspan may, at any time, add such increase to the Contract Price by      notifying Distributor in writing of such increase.\n\n8.   DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS.\n\n8.1  All Equipment and Software will be delivered by Airspan CIP (as      defined in Incoterms 2000) to an airport in South Dakota that completes      international customs clearances and shipped to a location within the city      limits of the above arrival airport, such airport and delivery location are      to be agreed upon in writing by the parties for each Purchase Order.      Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and      insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits. If      requested by Distributor, Airspan may arrange for shipment to be made to      Distributor's identified warehouse facilities or freight forwarder outside      of the city limits, subject to approval in writing by Airspan and agreement      to any additional charges in advance of shipment.  Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance.

In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).
