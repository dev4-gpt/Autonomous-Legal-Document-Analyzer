RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nTadeo will maintain accurate books, records and accounts of all transactions relating to the Services performed by it pursuant to this Agreement.

Diplomat acknowledges and agrees that Tadeo is in the business of designing and hosting Web sites, and that Tadeo shall have the right to provide to third parties services which are the same or similar to the Tadeo Services, and to use or otherwise exploit any Host Materials in providing such services.\n\nSection 9.     DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\n\n(a) In the event that any party to this Agreement has any claim, right or cause of action against any other party to this Agreement, which the parties shall be unable to settle by agreement between themselves, such claim, right or cause of action, to the extent that the relief sought by such party is for monetary damages or awards, shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"),\n\n\n\n\n\nthrough the adjudication by a single arbitrator, in New York, New York, with the decision of such arbitrator to be final and binding upon all parties.
