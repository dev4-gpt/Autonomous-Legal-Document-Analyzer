Indemnification payments as provided in Section 8.2;\n\nb.    damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property       and tangible personal property; and\n\n(c) the amount of any other actual direct damages, up to the greater of $100,000 or the charges paid by Customer to IBM for the Services in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the accrual of the first claim related to the Services. The foregoing limit also applies to any of Customer's Affiliates. It is the cumulative maximum for which Customer and its Affiliates are collectively responsible. Under no circumstances is Customer or its Affiliates liable for any third party claims against IBM for damages (other than those\n\n                                       6\n\nexpressly provided in Subsections 9.2(a) and 9.2(b)).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.0  Disclaimer of Consequential Damages\n\n\n\n\n\na.    In no event will either party be liable to the other for special,       incidental, or indirect damages or for any consequential damages       (including lost profits or savings), even if they are informed of the       possibility; provided that this Section 10 does not apply to Customer's       failure to pay any amounts owing to IBM under this Agreement (including       amounts owing for Services that would have been rendered but for       Customer's breach of this Agreement).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11.0  Other Customer Obligations\n\n11.1  Services Support\n\nCustomer will comply with its responsibilities to support the Services as specified in Attachment A and in applicable Service Option Attachments.

Unless otherwise specified in an SOA, such maintenance excludes upgrades to Base Components.

No goods are sold or leased by IBM under this Agreement. If Customer desires to purchase or to lease goods from IBM, such purchase or lease will be governed by a separate mutually acceptable written agreement between Customer and IBM or an IBM Affiliate.\n\n12.4  No Lease of Real Property\n\nThis Agreement is a services agreement and not a lease of any real property.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13.0  Changes\n\n13.1  Services\n\nIBM, in its reasonable discretion, may change the terms and conditions of Attachment A and/or Service Option Attachments, upon at least ninety (90) days prior notice to Customer. IBM may change the prices of Service Option Attachments after twelve (12) months following the applicable Service Option Attachment Start Date upon at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to Customer. Any such changes will not apply retroactively.

If the original intent of the parties can not be preserved, this Agreement shall either be renegotiated or terminated.\n\n14.6  Publicity and Trademarks\n\nNeither party grants the other the right to use its or any of its Affiliates' trademarks, trade names, or other designations in any promotion, publication, or Web site without prior written consent.
