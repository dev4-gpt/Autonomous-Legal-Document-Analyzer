In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the nondefaulting party hereunder, however, and if default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party, and if Company is the defaulting party, Company shall be responsible for any and all payments due under the terms of this Agreement in addition to other liabilities set forth above.\n\n         (b) If Company shall become bankrupt or insolvent, or if Company's business shall be placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, whether by voluntary act of Company or otherwise, the Contract Period shall, at the election of Licensor, immediately terminate.\n\n                                      -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n         12.

TRADEMARKS. Company agrees that it will not file, during the Contract Period or thereafter, any application for trademark registration or otherwise obtain or attempt to obtain ownership of any trademark or trade name within the Contract Territory or in any other country of the world which consists of the Duval Identification or any mark, design or logo intended to make reference to Duval or to identify products endorsed by Duval. In the event that, prior to commencement of the Contract Period, Company has filed one or more applications for registration of any such trademark, or otherwise has obtained any rights to such trademark, Company agrees to cause such applications and/or trademarks to be assigned and transferred to Licensor forthwith.\n\n         14. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. All rights not herein specifically granted to Company shall remain the property of Licensor to be used in any manner Licensor deems appropriate.

SPECIAL RIGHT OF TERMINATION. Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensor if the commercial value of the Duval Identification is substantially reduced because Duval (i) has engaged in illegal or immoral conduct resulting in a felony conviction; or (ii) fails an officially sanctioned drug test or is criminally convicted of any drug related offense. Any termination pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the 30th day next following the date of receipt by Licensor of Company's written notice to so terminate.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n         17. LIMITED LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event Company incurs any expenses, damages or other liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with the performance or non-performance of any term or provision hereof, Licensor's liability to Company shall not exceed the remuneration, excluding reimbursement of expenses, actually paid to Licensor by Company. In no event will Licensor be liable for any indirect, incidental, reliance, special or consequential damages arising out of the performance or non-performance of this Agreement, whether or not Licensor had been advised of the possibility of such damages. It is understood that Duval is not a party hereto and has no liability hereunder but is an intended specific third party creditor beneficiary hereof.\n\n         18. WAIVER. The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof and each may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other of said terms, covenants and conditions. Any waiver of such rights must be set forth in writing.\n\n         19. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the validity of any other provision and of the entire Agreement shall not be affected thereby.\n\n         20. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Licensor, and the successors and assigns of Licensor. The rights granted Company hereunder are personal to it, shall be used only by it or its affiliate and shall not without the prior written consent of Licensor be transferred or assigned to any other party. In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Licensor shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing within sixty (60) days following Licensor's receipt of notice of such merger or consolidation.\n\n         21. ARBITRATION/GOVERNING LAW. This agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its principals of conflicts of laws.
