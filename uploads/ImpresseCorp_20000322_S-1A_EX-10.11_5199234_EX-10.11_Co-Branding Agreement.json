ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim between the parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 6.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the State of Delaware.\n\n7\n\n6.3. EQUITABLE RELIEF. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] of this Agreement by either party, the party alleging such a violation may seek temporary and permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator. The party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n6.4. COSTS. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 6  [DISPUTE RESOLUTION], except that costs and expenses regarding the arbitrators shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other party. To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 4  [THE COMMERCIAL TERMS], the party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are incurred.\n\n6.5. TWO YEAR LIMITATION. Except for claims under Sections 9.4  [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and 9.5  [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET]\n\nSource: IMPRESSE CORP, S-1/A, 3/22/2000\n\n\n\n\n\nhereof, neither party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.\n\n6.6. CONFIDENTIALITY. In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the parties with respect to each party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other party hereto in accordance with Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY].\n\n6.7. REMEDIAL MEASURES. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach was received by the other party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching party may take reasonable remediable measures upon prior written notice and at the cost and expense of the breaching party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach. In addition, the non-breaching party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\n7.   CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n7.1. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other party in confidence and (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties, provided, the receiving party may disclose such Confidential Information to its employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such information for purposes of carrying out the terms of this Agreement. Neither party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the\n\n8\n\nreceiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, not less than reasonable care.\n\n7.2. EXCLUSIONS. \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was already known to the receiving party at the time it was disclosed to the receiving party, as evidenced by records of the receiving party; (c) is independently developed by employees of the receiving party who had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by records of the receiving party; (d) is received from a third party who is under no obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; or (e) must be disclosed pursuant to applicable laws, rules or regulations; provided, however, that the receiving party first gives the disclosing party notice and a reasonable opportunity to secure confidential protection of such Confidential Information.\n\n7.3. TERMINATION. Subject to Section 10.11  [SURVIVAL], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing party or, at the request of the disclosing party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement. Subject to Section 7.6  [USER DATA], the confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.\n\n7.4. INJUNCTION. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without posting a bond or other security.\n\n7.5. PUBLICITY. Neither party will originate any press release concerning the relationship between the parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, VerticalNet and Impresse shall jointly issue a press release with respect to entering into this Agreement.\n\n7.6. USER DATA. Impresse shall provide VerticalNet with User Data on each User that submits information through the Co-Branded Site by sending an email with such information to an email address designated by VerticalNet at the time the request occurs. User Data shall be maintained by each Party as Confidential Information of the other Party during the Term and 5 years thereafter, provided such User Data may be disclosed only as part of an aggregation or analysis of all User Data but not as independent data. Upon termination of the Agreement, VerticalNet and Impresse shall jointly own all User Data. Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy and all applicable laws during the Term and thereafter.\n\n9\n\n8.
