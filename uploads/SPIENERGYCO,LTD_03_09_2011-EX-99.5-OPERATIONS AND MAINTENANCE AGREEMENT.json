Owner desires to retain the services of Service Provider to operate and manage the SEF and provide scheduled maintenance of the SEF, and  Service Provider is willing to perform such services upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\nAGREEMENT\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements, representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and the  Exhibits hereto, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Owner and Service Provider agree as  follows:\n\nARTICLE 1.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF SERVICE PROVIDER\n\n1.1 Appointment of Service Provider.\n\n(a) Owner hereby appoints Service Provider, and Service Provider hereby accepts the appointment, to perform the SEF operations and maintenance  services (\"Services\") on behalf of Owner as of the Services Commencement Date as further described in Exhibit C hereto in accordance with and  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Service Provider shall perform the Services and its obligations under this  Agreement, and act at all times as an independent Service Provider of Owner. None of Service Provider's employees shall be, or shall be  considered to be, employees of Owner. Service Provider shall be fully responsible for the payment of all wages, salaries, benefits and other  compensation to its employees. This Agreement is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, and neither Party shall be or  constitute, or be deemed or construed to be or constitute, under any circumstances or for any purpose whatsoever, a partner, joint venturer, agent  (except as specifically provided in this Agreement) or legal representative of the other Party, and the Parties expressly disclaim any intention to  create a partnership, joint venture, association or other such relationship. Neither Party is granted any right or authority to assume or create any  obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any manner (except as  specifically provided in this Agreement).\n\n1.2 Performance of Maintenance Services. Service Provider shall perform the maintenance portion of the Services in a clean, safe, efficient and  environmentally reasonable manner and maintain the SEF in good operating and mechanical condition in accordance with this Agreement and (i)  all applicable laws and permits, (ii) all applicable express warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers, suppliers, or Service Providers who  provided materials or labor under the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement dated September 30, 2009 (the \"EPC Agreement\")  for the SEF subject to the terms and limitations thereof, and (iii) all manufacturer's maintenance instructions and specifications.\n\n1.3 Performance Objectives. Service Provider shall perform the Services and its obligations under this Agreement in a manner that (a) insures the  operation of the SEF within all required operational parameters and requirements, (b) preserves all warranties provided by manufacturers, suppliers,  or Service Providers who provided materials or labor under the EPC Agreement relating to the SEF, subject to Force Majeure, (c) maintains the SEF,  and\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) seeks to minimize the variable operating costs of and wear and tear on the SEF, including using commercially reasonable efforts to achieve  industry standard levels of SEF availability.\n\n1.4 Non-Covered Services.\n\n(a) The Services shall not include, and Service Provider shall not be responsible for, any operations, maintenance, repair, or other services beyond  the Services set forth in Exhibit C (such non-covered services referred to hereinafter as \"Non-Covered Services\"). All work associated with Non- Covered Services will be billed according to the terms of Section 2.2. Any studies or other services required by Owner to review options to  optimize system performance will be provided as Non-Covered Services.\n\n(b) The Performance of any Non-Covered Services by Service Provider shall require a written request from Owner specifying the Non-Covered  Services to be performed by Service Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the costs of Non-Covered Services to be performed by Service  Provider do not exceed $500.00 in any single instance, or (ii) the Non-Covered Services are provided by Service Provider on an emergency basis to  prevent an imminent danger of injury, loss, or damage (exceeding $500.00), Service Provider shall attempt to notify Owner via telephone prior to the  performance of any Non-Covered Services and shall be authorized to proceed with the performance of such Non-Covered Services upon receiving  verbal approval from Owner.

Service Provider shall make the SEF O&M Reports available to Owner in hard  copy and electronic formats.\n\n(b) Service Provider shall prepare reports and data related to the maintenance of hazardous materials introduced on-site by the Service Provider at  the SEF in a manner complying with all applicable laws.\n\n1.9 Performance of Operational Services Service Provider shall perform the operational portion of the Services in a professional manner consistent  with standards for the management and operation of an SEF of this size and type.\n\nARTICLE 2.

The Party receiving such documents or information shall not  publish or otherwise disclose them or use them for its own purposes (otherwise than as may be required by it, its professional advisers, or  potential or actual lenders or investors, or potential or actual subcontractors to perform its obligations or to assert its rights under this  Agreement). Each Party further agrees, to the extent requested by the supplier of such information, to require its subcontractors, vendors,  suppliers and employees to enter into appropriate nondisclosure agreements relative to such confidential information, prior to the receipt thereof.  To the extent reasonably required, confidential information may be made available to potential debt and equity investors and as necessary subject  to a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement or to respective advisors who are bound to confidentiality by applicable rules of professional  conduct or by mutually acceptable confidentiality agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall not apply to information within any one of  the following categories or any combination thereof: (1) information that was in the public domain prior to the receiving Party's receipt or that  subsequently becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, except by the receiving party's wrongful act; (2) information that the  receiving Party can demonstrate was in its possession prior to receipt thereof from the disclosing Party and not otherwise subject to an obligation  of confidentiality; or (3) information received by a Party from a third party having no obligation of secrecy with respect thereof.\n\n(b) The obligations of the Parties under this Section will survive for a period of two (2) years from and after the expiration or termination of the  Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 8.

ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT\n\n9.1 Assignment; Binding Effect.\n\n(a) Service Provider shall not, without the prior written consent of Owner, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, assign,  pledge or transfer all or any part of, or any right or obligation under, this Agreement, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, and any such  assignment or transfer without such consent will be null and void; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Service Provider may,  without the consent of Owner, assign,\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npledge or transfer all or any part of Service Provider's payment rights under this Agreement (i) to any affiliate of Service Provider, (ii) to any party  that acquires Service Provider or all or substantially all of Service Provider's assets, or (iii) for security purposes in connection with any financing  and, provided further, that Service Provider shall remain fully liable for the performance of all of Service Provider's obligations under this  Agreement.

Owner shall deliver  notice of any such assignment, pledge or transfer to Service Provider in writing as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Service Provider  agrees to execute such reasonable consents to assignment and other documents, and to provide such information, as is reasonably requested by  Owner in connection with any such assignment, pledge or transfer.\n\n(c) Subject to the foregoing restrictions on assignment, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their  respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n9.2 Cooperation with Financing. Service Provider acknowledges that Owner will be financing the acquisition of the SEF and Service Provider  agrees that it shall reasonably cooperate with Owner and its financing parties in connection with such financing for the SEF, including the  furnishing of such information and the giving of such certificates; provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not obligate Service Provider to  materially change any rights or benefits, or materially increase any burdens, liabilities or obligations of Service Provider, under this Agreement  (except for providing notices and additional cure periods to the financing parties with respect to Events of Defaults with respect to Owner as a  financing party may reasonably request).\n\nARTICLE 10.

If any part, term, or provision of this Agreement is determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,  illegal, or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect or impair the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other part, term, or provision of  this Agreement, and shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Rather the part of this Agreement that is found invalid or  unenforceable will be amended, changed, or interpreted to achieve as nearly as possible the same objectives and economic effect as the original  provision, or replaced to the extent possible, with a legal, enforceable, and valid provision that is as similar in tenor to the stricken provision, within  the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force\n\n10.6 No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement will provide any benefit to any third party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause  of action, remedy or right of any kind.\n\n10.7 No Recourse to Affiliates. This Agreement is solely and exclusively between the Parties, and any obligations created herein on the part of  either Party shall be the obligations solely of such Party. No Party shall have recourse to any parent, subsidiary, partner, member, affiliate, lender,  director, officer or employee of the other Party for performance or non-performance of any obligation hereunder, unless such obligations were  assumed in writing by the Person against whom recourse is sought.\n\n10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and in original or portable document format, and by the  different parties hereto on the same or separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument, and all of which together  shall constitute one and the same Agreement.\n\n10.9 Further Assurances. The Parties shall at their own cost and expense do such further acts, perform such further actions, execute and deliver  such further or additional documents and instruments as may be reasonably required or appropriate to consummate, evidence, or confirm the  agreements and understandings contained herein and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.\n\n10.10 General Interpretation. The terms of this Agreement have been negotiated by the Parties hereto and the language used in this Agreement  shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent. This Agreement shall be construed without regard  to any presumption or rule requiring construction against the Party causing such instrument of any portion thereof to be drafted, or in favor of the  Party receiving a particular benefit under this Agreement. No rule of strict construction will be applied against any person.\n\n10.11 Access to Premises. Owner shall furnish reasonable access to the Premises in order to allow Service Provider to perform the Services. Service  Provider's access to the Premises (including its agents, employees, and representatives) shall be subject to User's rules and regulations, security  policies and guidelines and access control systems and procedures (as provided by Owner to Service Provider as of the Effective Date). Owner  shall coordinate and provide for User's, or User's agent's, supervision of Service Provider, as may be required by User, in a manner that shall not  disrupt Service Provider's performance of the Services.\n\n10.12 No Claims against the Premises. Service Provider understands and acknowledges that the SEF is separate from, and not an improvement to or  a part of the Premises and that the SEF is separately owned by Owner. Owner, and not User, any owner, landlord, tenant, or subtenant of the  Premises, is solely responsible for the payment of all Services Fees, and Service Providers shall have no claim against the Premises for unpaid  Services Fees. Service Provider agrees not to attempt to record any lien against the Premises for unpaid Services Fees.\n\n10.13 Headings. The headings of the Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and do not form a part or affect the  meaning hereof.\n\n10.14 Public Announcements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each Party acknowledges that the other Party (the  \"Public Party\") is or may become a publicly-held company, and in conjunction with its duties as a publicly-held company, such Public Party may  from time to time be required to report to the public by filing appropriate disclosure statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission on  form 8(k,) periodical reports, or otherwise according to applicable securities laws and regulations, or through press releases (collectively, \"Public  Information\"); provided, however, that unless required by law, the Public Party shall not use the other Party's, Owner's, or User's name or brand  in such Public Information without prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Public Party shall have given the other Party,  Owner, or User advance notice and an opportunity to review and provide comment on such releases. On the Public Party's request, the other Party  shall provide a written description of information about such Party as it should appear in such filings.\n\n10.15 Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable for any failure to comply  with its obligations under the this Agreement, other than to pay moneys due, to the extent arising out of any circumstances not within the  reasonable control, directly or indirectly, of the Party affected (\"Force Majeure\"). Force Majeure shall include fire, explosion, flood, earthquake,  hurricane, tornado, storm, wind or other unusually adverse weather, civil commotions, civil disobedience, war, rebellion, sabotage, acts of civil or  military authority, acts of public enemy, acts of terrorism, boycotts, industry-wide strike or labor difficulties, acts of God, and any actions or  inactions by the local utility, but shall not include any inability to make payments that are due hereunder. Each Party shall be entitled to an  equitable adjustment for its performance obligations hereunder arising from Force Majeure. A Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly notify  the other party, specifying in reasonable detail the event of Force Majeure, the expected duration, and the steps such party is taking to remedy any  delay.\n\n[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nINTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, Owner and Service Provider have signed this Agreement through their duly authorized representatives  effective as of the latest date set forth below.\n\n\"OWNER:\"\n\nDate: December 11, 2009\n\nSOLAR TAX PARTNERS 1, LLC\n\nBy: /s/ HEK Partners, LLC by William Hedden and Steven Kay\n\nPrinted name: William Hedden and Steven Kay\n\nTitle: Members\n\nAddress:\n\n1838 15th Street\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\n\"SERVICE PROVIDER:\"\n\nDate: December 11, 2009\n\nSOLAR POWER, INC.\n\nBy: /s/ Todd Lindstrom\n\nPrinted name: Todd Lindstrom\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President\n\nTelephone: ( 916 ) 745-0900\n\nAddress:\n\n1115 Orlando Drive  Roseville, CA 95661\n\nTelephone: (916) 745-0900  Telefax: (916) 721-0428\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpertations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT A\n\nSEF DESCRIPTION\n\n3.6 MW SYSTEM\n\n(17,632) SPI SP205 MODULES\n\n(6) (AE 500KW) INVERTERS\n\n(3) 480V-12.7 KV TRANSFORMERS\n\nSEF IS A SINGLE AXIS CONERGY TRACKER SYSTEM\n\nExhibit A-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT B\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREMISES\n\nAEROJET \u2014 PHASE 1\n\nRANCHO CORDOVA, CA\n\nExhibit B-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT C\n\nSCOPE OF SERVICES\n\nAs of the Delivery Date (as defined in the EPC) (\"Services Commencement Date\"), Service Provider shall provide the Services marked below as  frequently as indicated below in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement:\n\nMAINTENANCE SERVICE SCHEDULE\n\nExhibit C-1\n\n          SERVICES         INCLUDED         (ONLY IF         CHECKED)   SERVICE DESCRIPTION   SERVICE FREQUENCY \u00fe\n\n\n\nINSPECTION OF SEF'S GENERAL SITE CONDITIONS, PV ARRAYS, ELECTRICAL  EQUIPMENT, MOUNTING STRUCTURE, DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM, AND  BALANCE OF SYSTEM PROVIDED UNDER EPC.\n\nBI-ANNUALLY (TBD)\n\n          \u00fe     SYSTEM TESTING, INCLUDING STRING LEVEL OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND DC  OPERATING AMPERAGE TESTS.
