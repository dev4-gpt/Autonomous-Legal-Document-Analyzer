If permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure may be provided by reference to or incorporation by reference from reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act.\n\n(iv) UBS AG agrees that, in the event that UBS AG provides Swap Financial Disclosure to the Depositor in accordance with paragraph (iii)(a) above, or causes its affiliate to provide Swap Financial Disclosure to the Depositor in accordance with paragraph (iii)(c) above, it will indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, its respective directors or officers and any person controlling the Depositor, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (any \"Damage\") caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Swap Financial Disclosure or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state in such Swap Financial Disclosure a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however that the foregoing shall not apply to any Damage caused by the negligence or any willful action of the Depositor or any other party (other than UBS AG or any of its affiliates or any of their respective agents), including without limitation any failure to calculate the Significance Percentage according to the terms of this Agreement or to make any\n\n\n\n\n\nfiling as and when required under Regulation AB.\n\n(v) In the event that UBS AG provides the information referred to above, such information shall be provided not later than five (5) business days prior to the date in which the Master Servicer is required to file a Form 10-D for such Distribution Date.\n\nFor the purposes hereof:\n\n\"Calculation Methodology\" means such method for determining maximum probable exposure of a derivative contract as reasonably determined by the Depositor.\n\n\"Swap Financial Disclosure\" means the financial information specified in Item   1115 of Regulation AB relating to the applicable Significance Percentage and   any necessary auditors consents relating to such financial information.\n\nAdditional Termination Events:\n\nThe following Additional Termination Events will apply to UBS AG:\n\n1. Ratings Event. If a Ratings Event (as defined below) has occurred and UBS AG has not complied with the requirements set forth in the succeeding paragraph within the 30 day time period specified therein, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG and UBS AG shall be the sole Affected Party with respect to such an Additional Termination Event.\n\nRating Agency Downgrade:\n\nIf a Ratings Event occurs with respect to UBS AG, then UBS AG shall, at       its own expense, (i) assign this Transaction hereunder to a third party       within thirty (30) days of such Ratings Event that meets or exceeds, or as       to which any applicable credit support provider meets or exceeds, the       Approved Rating Threshold (as defined below) on terms substantially       similar to this Confirmation or (ii) deliver collateral acceptable in a       form and amount acceptable to Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\") and Moody's       Investors Service Inc. (\"Moody's) within thirty (30) days of such Ratings       Event and subject to written confirmation from Fitch and Moody's that       delivery of such collateral in the context of such downgrade will not       result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of the then current       ratings assigned to the Certificates. For the avoidance of doubt, a       downgrade of the rating on Wells Fargo Mortgage Backed Securities 2006-6       Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-6, Class I-A-22       (the \"Certificates\") could occur in the event that UBS AG does not post       sufficient collateral.\n\nFor purposes of this Transaction, a \"Ratings Event\" shall occur with       respect to UBS AG if its long term unsecured debt rating (the \"Long Term       Rating\") ceases to be rated at least \"A1\" by Moody's Investors Service,       Inc. or at least \"A+ by Fitch Ratings (such ratings being referred to as       the \"Approved Ratings Threshold\"), (unless, within 30 days after such       withdrawal or downgrade Fitch and Moody's have reconfirmed the rating of       the Certificates which were in effect immediately prior to such withdrawal       or downgrade).\n\n2. Swap Disclosure Event.
