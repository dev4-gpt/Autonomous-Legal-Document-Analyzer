Accordingly, the Services under this Agreement are zero-rated                for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax (hereinafter                 referred to as \"GST\") pursuant to Section 1 of Part VII of                Schedule VI of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, Chapter E-15,                as amended from time to time.\n\n    (b)     In the event that \"GST\" or any other value added or sales taxes                are applicable at any time during the Term of this Agreement:\n\n                 (i)    Either party shall be liable for the same, if                             applicable;\n\n                 (ii)   Either Party shall identify such tax separately on                             each invoice; and\n\n                 (iii)  Either Party's GST registration number shall                             appear on each invoice.\n\n6.0    LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE\n\n6.1    A Party shall be liable to the other for loss, damage or delay to        Freight due to its acts or omissions, including its negligence, and        those of its employees, agents and those for whom in law it is        responsible and occurring while Freight is in its care, custody or        control. For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered        in the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is tendered        to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of        its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. For        greater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight        is damaged solely as a result of improper packing.\n\n6.2    A Party shall, in the event of loss, damage or delay to Freight while in        its care, custody or control, immediately notify the other Party of the         loss or damage, carry out an investigation of the incident to determine        the cause of such loss, damage or delay and shall within\n\n7        thirty (30) days of the event of loss, damage or delay or knowledge of        such incident of loss, damage or delay, whichever is later, as the case        may be, report its findings to the other Party. All costs associated        with such investigation shall be the responsibility of such Party if the        loss, damage or delay was due to the acts or omissions or those of its        employees, agents or those for whom in law its is responsible;        otherwise, the costs shall be shared equally by the Parties hereto.\n\n6.3    A party shall, for any loss, damage or delay to Freight while in its        care, custody or control, forthwith pay to the other Party the actual        damages suffered by such other Party. Such liability shall not exceed the        other Party's contractual liability to its customers. The Parties        acknowledge that their contract of carriage with their customers provides        that liability for loss, damage or delay, including liability for        consequential loss, is limited to Four Dollars and Forty One Cents        ($4.41) per kilogram or Two Dollars ($2.00) per pound unless a higher        value has been declared for insurance purposes.\n\n7.0    SET-OFF\n\n7.1    A Party shall pay to the other the full amount of any paid claim, loss        or damage for which it is liable within forty five (45) days following           presentation of supporting documentation. If a Party fails to pay        following presentation of supporting documentation then the other Party        shall have the right to deduct the amount of such claim, loss or damage        from any monies due or becoming due to the first Party by the second        Party.\n\n8.0    INDEMNIFICATION\n\n8.1    Each Party shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless the other, its        directors, officers, employees and any others for whom it may be        responsible in law, from and against all claims, including claims made        by the indemnifying Party's personnel under worker's compensation        legislation, demands, awards, judgments, actions and proceedings by        whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted in respect of loss of, damage to        or destruction of property (including loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying party) or personal injury including death and from and        against any and all loss or, damage to or destruction of property,        expenses and costs (including legal fees and disbursements) suffered or        incurred by the indemnifying Party, its directors, officers, employees\n\n\n\n\n\n    and any others for whom it may be responsible in law, arising out of or        in any way connected with the indemnifying Party, its directors,        officers, employees and any others for whom it may be responsible in law,        arising out of or in any way connected with the indemnifying Party        provision of Services under this Agreement and whether or not caused by        the indemnifying Party's negligence. Loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying Party shall also include loss as a result of loss of use.\n\n8                                      - 8 -\n\n8.2    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the        indemnifying party's liability to the other hereunder shall not        exceed the insurance coverage set out in Section 9.0.\n\n9.0    INSURANCE\n\n9.1    Each Party shall purchase and maintain, at its own expense, the        following insurance coverages:\n\n    (a)     cargo liability insurance, subject to a combined single limit of                not less than One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000.00)                inclusive per occurrence. The other Party shall be named as an                additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross                liability clause;\n\n    (b)     automobile, non-owned automobile, fleet, comprehensive general,                public and property liability insurance with a limit of not less                than Two Million dollars ($2,000,000.00) inclusive of bodily                injury and property damage for any one occurrence arising out of                one (1) cause. The policy shall cover all non-air operations,                non-owned automobile, contractual liability and liability                specifically assumed under this Agreement.

It shall        be the sole responsibility of each Party to determine what additional        insurance coverages, if any, are necessary and advisable for its own        protection\n\n9                                      - 9 -\n\n    or to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement. Any such additional        insurance shall be provided and maintained by that Party at its own        expense.\n\n9.6    Each Party shall ensure that any subcontractor or other party with whom        it contracts in providing the Services shall carry adequate        insurance coverage, but not less than that provided in paragraph 9.1.\n\n10.1   COMPLIANCE WITH LAW\n\n10.1   (a)     Each Party shall comply with all legislation directly or                indirectly applicable to the performance of its obligations                under this Agreement.\n\n    (b)     Each Party shall notify the other at least thirty (30) days or                in any event as soon as possible, before any change is made in                its licences or operating authorities which may affect in any                way the performance of any of its obligations under this                Agreement.\n\n11.0   PROTECTION OF FREIGHT\n\n11.1   Each Party shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that Freight in        its care, custody or control is protected at all times from theft,        weather and all other damage or danger, and without restricting the        foregoing, shall ensure that:\n\n    (a)     Freight is not kept out-of-doors except for purposes of loading                or off loading; and\n\n    (b)     If at any time Freight is not under its complete visual and                physical control, it shall provide a secure storage area\n\n\n\n\n\n            in a facility at its own cost.\n\n12.0   SECURITY\n\n12.1   Each Party shall ensure that all reasonable security and investigation        measures are implemented including but not limited to the provisions set        forth in Schedule \"F\" respecting the provision of Services.\n\n12.2   Each Party shall implement and put in place security and investigation           procedures to ensure the protection and security of Freight. These        procedures shall include spot checks, inspections, reporting,        investigations and any other procedures to ensure not only that the        Services required by the other Party are provided but that the Services        are provided in accordance with industry standards.\n\n10                                      - 10 -\n\n13.0   DANGEROUS GOODS\n\n13.1   The Parties acknowledge that the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act,        S.C. 1992, c.34, as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred        to as the \"TDGA\") prohibits transportation of any explosive, dangerous         or destructive substance, or anything likely to injure or damage property        or persons (hereinafter referred to as \"Dangerous Goods\") unless the        requirements of the TDGA are met. The Parties agree that they only intend        for Dangerous Goods to be carried pursuant to this Agreement if the        requirements of the TDGA are met and both Parties are aware that such        goods are being carried. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree        that neither Dynamex nor Purolator shall be under any obligation or duty        whatsoever to open for prior inspection any Freight tendered to Dynamex        pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party shall be responsible for any        losses or damage whatsoever that may be sustained by the other Party, its        directors, officers, employees and any persons for whom it may become        responsible in law, as a result of any Dangerous Goods contained in        Freight unless such Party had actual prior knowledge of the presence of        Dangerous Goods. In the event a Party had actual prior knowledge of the        presence of Dangerous Goods, then it shall be liable for loss or damage        to the other Party if it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement        or at law.\n\n13.2   Each Party must comply with the placarding and all other regulations        applicable to the handling of Dangerous Goods.

Each Party agrees to promptly advise the        other of any changes to its Dangerous Goods Handling Procedures.\n\n14.0   RECORDS AND REPORTS    14.1   Each Party shall maintain performance reports, comparing actual to        scheduled departure and arrival times for Services provided. Such        reports shall be made available for review by the other Party and in        connection with same, a Party shall provide copies of all data and        records relating thereto.\n\n11                                      - 11 -\n\n14.2   Each Party shall maintain complete maintenance and operational records.\n\n14.3   Each Party shall keep accurate books, accounts and records covering all         transactions relating to this Agreement, including books of original        entry, and upon request from the other Party, shall allow access to        same.\n\n14.4   Either Party shall have the right to request the other to provide,        through an auditor agreed to by the Parties, validation of the        information and data referred to herein.\n\n15.0   CONTINGENCY PLANS\n\n15.1   In the event a Party is unable to provide the Services as a result of a        strike or other labour disruption caused by its employees, it shall              attempt to subcontract the Services to another operator or operators,        acceptable to the other Party. Such Services shall be provided by such        subcontractor/subcontractors on the same terms and conditions herein set        out and will be continued to be provided during the period of any such        strike or labour disruption, unless this Agreement is otherwise        terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. It is        understood and agreed that, if such Party provides the Services by        subcontracting to another operator/operators, then it shall be deemed        not to be in default pursuant to paragraph 17.1(c). Notwithstanding        same, all other default provisions as set out in paragraph 17, continue        to apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.0   SERVICE FAILURE REMEDIES\n\n16.1   In the event that Monthly Performance Failures occur more than three (3)        times in any twelve (12) month period, an Event of Default shall have         occurred.\n\n17.0   DEFAULT PROVISIONS\n\n17.1   For the purposes of this Agreement, the following shall constitute        events of default by a Party (hereinafter referred to as \"Events of         Default\"):\n\n    (a)     if a petition is filed against it under any applicable bankruptcy                legislation and is not withdrawn or dismissed within sixty                (60) days thereafter;\n\n    (b)     if a resolution is passed by it respecting the sale of all or                substantially all of its assets, or an order for the winding                 up of its business is made, or it otherwise agrees to make a                 bulk sale of it's assets;\n\n    (c)     if it ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business;\n\n12                                      - 12 -\n\n     (d)     if it commits or threatens to commit an act of bankruptcy, or                 if it becomes insolvent or bankrupt or makes an assignment or if                 a receiver or receiver manager is appointed in respect of its                 business and affairs of either by way of private instrument or                 through court proceedings;\n\n     (e)     if a judgment or order is entered with respect to it under the                 Company Creditors Arrangement Act R.S.C. 1985, Chapter C-36, as                 amended, or similar legislation, or it takes advantage of the                 provisions of any bankruptcy or insolvency legislation;\n\n     (f)     if any execution, or any other process of any court becomes                 enforceable against all or substantially all of it's property or                 if a distress or analogous process is levied against all or                 substantially all of its property;\n\n     (g)     if it is in default as per paragraph 16.1 hereof; or\n\n     (h)     if it otherwise neglects or fails to perform or observe any of                 its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure the                 breach or default within thirty (30) days of written notice to                 the other Party.\n\n17.2    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to any         rights or remedies available to it under this Agreement or at law or in         equity, the Party not in default may exercise any or all of the         following remedies:\n\n     (a)     terminate this Agreement, upon giving one hundred and twenty                 (120) days written notice, otherwise upon written notice with                 respect to 17.1 (g) and (h);\n\n     (b)     recover from the defaulting Party any and all monies then due                 and to become due;
