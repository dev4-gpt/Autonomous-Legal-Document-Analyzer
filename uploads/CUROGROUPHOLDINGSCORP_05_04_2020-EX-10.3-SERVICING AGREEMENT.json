Servicing Duties of the Servicer.\n\n(a) The Owner authorizes Curo Management, LLC, to act, and Curo Management, LLC, agrees to act, as an independent contractor, as the Servicer effective upon the date hereof.\n\n(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and shall extend, amend or otherwise modify such Serviced Asset, by complying in all material respects with the following (collectively, the \"Servicing Standard\"): (A) reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable receivables that it services for itself or others, and (B) Applicable Law.\n\n(c) The Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder,\n\n\n\n\n\nincluding any Sub-Servicer, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Servicing Standard. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless such power is revoked by the Owner on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, the Servicer shall have full power and authority (i) to make withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account permitted by the terms of this Servicing Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Owner, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Servicing Standard and the Loan Agreement, to commence collection proceedings with respect to such Receivables. The Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any documents reasonably requested by the Servicer, including powers of attorney, as necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer (or any Sub-Servicer on its behalf) to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.\n\n(d) The Servicer shall collect and process all collections on the Serviced Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.3 of the Loan Agreement and the Servicing Multi-Party Agreement.\n\nSection 2.

The indemnities contained in this Section 2(c) shall survive the resignation and removal of the Servicer or the termination of this Agreement.\n\n(d) Subject to Sections 4 and 5, the Servicer shall administer, perform or supervise the performance of such other activities in connection with the Serviced Assets (including the Loan Documents) as are not covered by any of the foregoing provisions and are reasonably within the capability of the Servicer. In no case may Servicer use any identifiable information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information and related account performance and status information, for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that Servicer is permitted to use nonidentifiable, aggregated consumer information obtained in connection with its activities undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be obligated to, and shall not, take any action that the Owner directs the Servicer not to take or which could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of the Owner's covenants, agreements or obligations under any of the Loan Documents.\n\n(f) The Servicer shall maintain appropriate books of account and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of account and records shall be accessible for inspection by the Owner at any time during normal business hours.\n\nSection 3.

Independence of the Servicer. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the Owner with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, Servicer shall be subject to the Owner's third-party vendor management program. Unless expressly authorized by the Owner in this Agreement or otherwise, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or represent the Owner in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Owner.\n\nSection 5. No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall constitute the Servicer and the Owner as members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any obligation or liability on behalf of the others.\n\nSection 6. Other Activities of Servicer. Nothing herein shall prevent the Servicer or its respective Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity for any other person or entity even though such person or entity may engage in business activities similar to those of the Owner.\n\nSection 7. Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Servicer.\n\n(a) This Agreement shall continue in force until the earlier to occur of (i) the Owner no longer owns any Receivables or Participation Interests, and (ii) subject to Section 7(d), the delivery of written notice of termination by the Owner to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7(c), in each case upon which event this Agreement shall automatically terminate unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Servicer and the Owner.\n\n(b) Subject to Section 7(d), the Servicer may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Owner with at least 60 days' prior written notice.\n\n(c) Subject to Section 7(d), and subject to the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, the Owner may remove the Servicer immediately upon written notice of termination from the Owner to the Servicer if any of the following events shall occur (each, a \"Servicer Termination Right - Owner\"):\n\n(i) the Servicer shall default in the performance of any of its duties under this Agreement and, after notice of such default, shall not cure such default within 30 days (or, if such default cannot be cured in such time, shall not give within 30 days such assurance of cure as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner); or\n\n(ii) the Servicer files or consents to the filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization statute, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or\n\n(iii) the Servicer fails to maintain, in any material respect, all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which it is performing the primary servicing function for any of the Serviced Assets under this Agreement.\n\nThe Servicer agrees that if any of the events specified in clause (ii) of this Section 7(c) shall occur, it shall give written notice thereof to the Owner within seven (7) days after the occurrence of such event.\n\n(d) No termination, resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be effective until (i) a successor Servicer shall have been appointed by or on behalf of the Owner with the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, and (ii) such successor Servicer shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as the Servicer is bound hereunder.\n\n(e) Agent may terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement by delivery of written notice of termination from Agent to Owner and Servicer (a \"Servicer Termination Right - Agent\" and, together with the Servicer Termination Right - Owner, each a \"Servicer Termination Right\"):\n\nIf a successor Servicer does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Servicer resigns or is removed, the resigning or removed Servicer or the Owner may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Servicer.\n\nIn the event that the Servicer resigns or is terminated hereunder, the Servicer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to and shall cooperate with the Owner and take other reasonable steps requested by the Owner to assist in the orderly and efficient transfer of the administration of the Serviced Assets to the successor Servicer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Action upon Termination, Resignation or Removal of the Servicer. Promptly upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall be entitled to be paid all fees and reimbursable expenses, including any reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, accruing to it to the date of such termination, resignation or removal. The Servicer shall forthwith upon such termination pursuant to Section 7 deliver to the successor Servicer all property and documents of or relating to the Serviced Assets then in the custody of the Servicer, or if this Agreement has been terminated, to the Owner. In the event of the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and take all reasonable steps requested to assist the Owner in making an orderly transfer of the duties of the Servicer.\n\nSection 9. Compensation. The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.\n\nSection 10. Sub-Servicers; Collection Agents.\n\n(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.\n\n(b) The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the subservicing of the Serviced Assets by any Sub-Servicer so appointed at any time in its sole discretion, provided, that any subservicing agreement entered into by Servicer with any such Sub-Servicer shall terminate by its terms no later than thirty (30) days after the Servicer is terminated as the servicer under this Agreement.\n\n(c) Each Sub-Servicer shall be entitled to compensation for its services as a Sub-Servicer as agreed to by the Servicer and such Sub-Servicer provided that any sub-servicing fees payable to the Sub-Servicer in respect of its servicing activities shall be payable out of the Servicing Fee.\n\n(d) Any subservicing arrangement that may be entered into and any other transactions or services relating to the Serviced Assets involving a Sub-Servicer in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be solely between the Sub-Servicer and the Servicer alone, and the Owner shall not be deemed party thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer in such capacity.\n\n(e) The Owner may, from time to time, enter into Collection Agency Agreements with Collection Agents for the collection of delinquent or defaulted accounts. Any such Collection Agent shall not be deemed a \"Sub-Servicer\" hereunder and the Servicer shall have no liability with respect to the acts or omissions of any such Collection Agent. Any Collection Fees shall be paid directly by the Owner in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and provide such assistance as is reasonably necessary to transfer servicing of applicable Serviced Assets to the related Collection Agent.\n\nSection 11.
