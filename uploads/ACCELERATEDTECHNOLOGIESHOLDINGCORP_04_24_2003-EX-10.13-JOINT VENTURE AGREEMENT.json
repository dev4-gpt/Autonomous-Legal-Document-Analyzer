(\"PVSS\"), (the \"Parties\" or \"Joint Venturers\" if referred to collectively, or the \"Party\" or Joint Venturer\" if referred to singularly), by this Agreement associate themselves as business associates, and not as partners, in the formation of a joint venture (the \"Joint Venture\"), for the purpose of engaging generally in the business provided for by terms and provisions of this Agreement.\n\n1.

The principal place of business of the Joint      Venture shall be at 1600 Lower State Road, in the City of Doylestown, Bucks      County, Pennsylvania, but may maintain such other offices as the Joint      Venturers may deem advisable at any other place or places within or without      the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n5.   Powers and Authority of the Joint Venturers. The Joint Venturers shall have      full and complete charge of all affairs of the Joint Venture.

The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books      and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs      conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and      expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the      distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the      business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than      those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be\n\n\n\n\n\n     paid by the Joint Venture. The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be      the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting.

Further, each Party      elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded      from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1      of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out      of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary,      be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate      documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any      agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this      Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation      of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business      for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with      each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the      performance of their joint venture business operation.\n\n11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.\n\n12.  Sale or Purchase of Interest of Joint Venturer Prohibited. No Joint      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the      consent of the other Joint Venturer.\n\n13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.\n\n14.  Construction. The Joint Venturers declare that in entering into this      Agreement, they have contracted with reference to the laws of the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the construction and interpretation of      the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and      construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except in      such cases and to such extent as the laws of another jurisdiction shall      necessarily control.\n\n15.  Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding on the Joint Venturers and their      respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators, and assigns.\n\n16.  Counterparts.
