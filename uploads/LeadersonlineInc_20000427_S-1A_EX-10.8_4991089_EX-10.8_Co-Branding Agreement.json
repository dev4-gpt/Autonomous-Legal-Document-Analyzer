DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n    8.1.  Negotiation and Escalation.  If any controversy or claim arises relating to this Agreement, the Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any controversy or claim through senior levels of management.

Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration].  The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.  The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter.  The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement.  Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n    8.3.  Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 9 of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary and permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator.  The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n    8.4.  Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.  To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred.\n\n    8.5.  Two Year Limitation.  Except for claims under Sections 11.4  [Indemnification by LeadersOnline] and 11.5  [Indemnification by VerticalNet] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to\n\n                                       9\n\nthis Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.\n\n    8.6.  Confidentiality.  In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the Parties with respect to each Party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party hereto in accordance with Article 9.\n\n    8.7.  Remedial Measures. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures upon prior written notice and at the cost and expense of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach.  In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\nSource: LEADERSONLINE INC, S-1/A, 4/27/2000\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

The Parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision.

Termination.  Subject to Section 12.12  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or, at the request of the disclosing Party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement.  The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 9 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.\n\n                                       10\n\n    9.4.  Injunction.  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 9 may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate.  Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 9 by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 9, without posting a bond or other security.\n\n    9.5.  Publicity. Except as may be required by law in which case a party will provide as much advance notice as reasonably possible, neither Party will originate any press release concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, VerticalNet and LeadersOnline shall jointly issue a press release with respect to entering into this Agreement.\n\n    9.6.  User Data. LeadersOnline shall provide VerticalNet with User Data on each User that enters the LeadersOnline Site through a Link from a VerticalNet Site and submits information through the LeadersOnline Site by sending an email with such information to an email address designated by VerticalNet at the time the request occurs.  User Data shall be maintained by each Party as Confidential Information of the other Party during the Term and 5 years thereafter, provided such User Data may be disclosed only as part of an aggregation or analysis of all User Data but not as independent data.  Upon termination of the Agreement, VerticalNet and LeadersOnline shall jointly own all User Data.
