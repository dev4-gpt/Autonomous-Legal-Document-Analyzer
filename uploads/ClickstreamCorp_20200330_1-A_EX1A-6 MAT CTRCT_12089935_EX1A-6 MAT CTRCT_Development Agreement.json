PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM. To create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting platform. The Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non- professional betting market. A landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices. Developer will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be uploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client. The applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other sports betting platforms. The app will be developed under the following considerations: \u25cf Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment. \u25cf Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+ \u25cf Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API \u25cf HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap Core Platform The Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact with a platform for free in order to win real money. Our primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes more of the female population. Our games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from push notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 - 4 times per month. Because the format doesn't change, we can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as Soccer and Nascar. Games and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api's Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual option to allow customs events that can be run through the platform. Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are more top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10. Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors will pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their product/company.\n\n8 \u2502 Page\n\nSource: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting. Monetization We will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to begin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising. B. SERVICES. The Developer will develop the mobile application based on the Client's specifications, will assist the Client in acquiring corporate sponsors and will operate and maintain the Application System through hosting of games including customer support.
