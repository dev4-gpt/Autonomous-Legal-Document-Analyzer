After samples have been approved pursuant to this paragraph, Diplomat shall not depart therefrom in any material respect without KI, Inc.'s prior written consent. From time to time after Diplomat has commenced selling the products, and upon KI, Inc.'s written request, Diplomat shall furnish without cost to KI, Inc. not more than ten (10) additional random samples of each product being manufactured and sold by Diplomat under this Agreement, together with any containers and packing and wrapping material used in connection with such products.\n\n                                       6\n\n            10. Labeling.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat agrees that it will cause to appear on or within       each product sold by it under this license and on or within all       advertising, promotional, or display material bearing KI's name (i) the       notice \"Copyright (c) (year) ______\" and any other notice desired by KI,       Inc and (ii) where such product, advertising, promotional, or display       material bears a trademark or service mark, appropriate statutory notice       of registration or application for registration thereof. In the event that       any product is marketed in a carton, container, packing or wrapping       material bearing KI's name, such notice shall also appear upon the said       carton, container, packing or wrapping material. Each and every tag,       label, imprint, or other device containing any such notice and all       advertising, promotional or display material bearing KI's name shall be       submitted by Diplomat to KI, Inc. for its written approval prior to use by       Diplomat. Approval by KI, Inc. shall not constitute waiver of KI, Inc.'s       rights or Diplomat's duties under any provision of this Agreement.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat agrees to cooperate fully and in good faith with       KI, Inc., at the expense of KI, Inc., for the purpose of securing and       preserving KI, Inc.'s (or any grantor of KI, Inc.'s) rights in and to KI's       name. It is agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be       construed as an assignment or grant to Diplomat of any right, title or       interest in or to KI's name, it being understood that all rights relating       thereto are reserved by KI, Inc., except for the license hereunder to       Diplomat of the right to use and utilize KI's name only as specifically       and expressly provided in this Agreement. Diplomat hereby agrees that at       the termination or expiration of this Agreement Diplomat will be deemed to       have assigned, transferred and conveyed to KI, Inc. any trade rights,       equities, good will, titles or other rights in and to KI's name which may       have been obtained by Diplomat or which may have vested in Diplomat in       pursuance of any endeavors covered by this Agreement, and that Diplomat       will execute any instruments requested by KI, Inc. to accomplish or       confirm the foregoing. Any such assignment, transfer, or conveyance shall       be without consideration other than the mutual covenants and       considerations of this Agreement.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat hereby agrees that its every use of KI's name       shall inure to the benefit of KI, Inc. and that Diplomat shall not at any       time acquire any rights in KI's name by virtue of any use it may make of       such name.\n\n            11. Promotional Material.\n\n                  (a) In all cases where Diplomat desires artwork to be created       involving products that are the subject of this license, the cost of such       artwork and the time for the production thereof shall be borne by       Diplomat. All artwork and designs involving KI's name, or any reproduction       thereof, shall, notwithstanding their invention or use by Diplomat, be and       remain the\n\n                                       7\n\n      property of SW, and SW shall be entitled to use the same and to license       the use of the same by others.\n\n                  (b) KI, Inc. shall have the right, but shall not be under any\n\n\n\n\n\n      obligation, to use KI's name and/or the name of Diplomat so as to give       KI's name, KI, Inc., or KI, Inc.'s programs full and favorable prominence       and publicity. KI, Inc. shall not be under any obligation whatsoever to       use KI's name, or any person, character, symbol, design, likeness, or       visual representation thereof in any radio or television program.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat agrees not to offer for sale, advertise, or       publicize any of the products licensed hereunder on radio or television       without the prior written approval of KI, Inc., which approval KI, Inc.       may grant or withhold in its unfettered discretion.\n\n            12. Distribution.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat agrees that during the term of this license it       will diligently and continuously manufacture, distribute and sell the       products covered by this Agreement and that it will make and maintain       adequate arrangements for the distribution of the products.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat agrees that it will sell and distribute the       products covered by this Agreement (i) to jobbers, wholesalers and       distributors for sale and distribution to retail stores and merchants, and       (ii) to retail stores and merchants for sale and distribution direct to       the public. Diplomat shall not, without the prior written consent of KI,       Inc., sell or distribute such products to jobbers, wholesalers,       distributors, retail stores, or merchants whose sales or distribution are       or will be made for publicity or promotional tie-in purposes, combination       sales, premiums, give-aways, or similar methods of merchandising. In the       event any sale is made at a special price to any of Diplomat's       subsidiaries or to any other person, firm or corporation related in any       manner to Diplomat or its officers, directors or major stockholders, there       shall be a royalty paid on such sales based upon the price generally       charged the trade by Diplomat.\n\n                  (c) Diplomat agrees to sell to KI, Inc. such quantities of the       products at as low a rate and on as good terms as Diplomat sells similar       quantities of the products to the general trade.\n\n            13. Records.\n\n            Diplomat agrees to keep accurate books of account and records covering all transactions relating to the license hereby granted. KI, Inc. and its duly-authorized representatives shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable hours of the day, to visit the offices of Diplomat one time each calendar quarter for the purpose of examining said books of account and records, and all other documents and materials in the possession or under the control of Diplomat, with respect to the\n\n                                       8\n\nsubject matter and terms of this Agreement, and shall have free and full access thereto for said purposes and for the purpose of making extracts therefrom. Upon demand of KI, Inc., Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. a detailed statement by an independent certified public accountant showing the number, description, gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat to the date of KI, Inc.'s demand. The cost of preparing such statement shall be borne by KI, Inc. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the prepared statement indicates that KI, Inc., received less than all royalties payable to it under this Agreement, and the differential between the royalties received and those payable amounts to more than  % of the royalties received, then the cost of such statement shall be borne by Diplomat. In the event books of account and records shall be kept available for at least two (2) years after the termination of this license.\n\n            14. Bankruptcy, Violation, Etc.\n\n                  (a) If Diplomat shall not have commenced in good faith to       manufacture or distribute in commercial quantities sunglasses and       ophthalmic frames using KI's name within three months after the date of       this Agreement, or if at any time thereafter in any six calendar month       period Diplomat fails to sell or distribute sunglasses or ophthalmic       frames, or any other product described in subparagraph 2(a) of this       Agreement, KI Inc. may give notice of such failure with respect to any       such product which has not been so manufactured or distributed during the       six calendar month period. In the event that Diplomat does not commence       selling such product in commercial quantities within 90 days after such       notice, such notice shall be deemed to be a termination of this License       with respect to such product.\n\n                  (b) If Diplomat files a petition in bankruptcy, or is       adjudicated a bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against       Diplomat, or if it becomes insolvent, or it makes an assignment for the       benefit of its creditors or an arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law,       or if Diplomat discontinues its business, or if a receiver is appointed       for it or its business, the license hereby granted shall automatically       terminate forthwith without any notice whatsoever being necessary. In the       event this license is so terminated, Diplomat, its receivers,       representatives, trustees, agents, administrators, successors and/or       assigns shall have no right to sell, exploit or in any way deal with or in       any of the products covered by this Agreement, or any carton, container,       packing or wrapping material, advertising, promotional or display material       pertaining thereto, except with and under the special consent and       instructions of KI, Inc. in writing, which they shall be obligated to       follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (c) If Diplomat shall violate any of its other material       obligations under the terms of this Agreement, KI, Inc. shall have the       right to terminate the license hereby granted upon twenty (20) days'       notice in writing, and such notice of termination shall become effective       unless Diplomat shall\n\n                                       9\n\n      completely remedy the violation within the twenty-day period and satisfy       KI, Inc. that such violation has been remedied.\n\n                  (d) Termination of the license under the provisions of this       paragraph 14 shall be without prejudice to any rights which KI, Inc. may       otherwise have against Diplomat. Upon the termination of this license,       notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all royalties on sales       theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum       royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            15. Final Statement Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Sixty (60) days before the expiration of this license and, in the event of its termination, ten (10) days after receipt of notice of termination or the happening of the event which terminates this Agreement where no notice is required, a statement showing the number and description of products covered by this Agreement on hand or in process shall be furnished by Diplomat to KI, Inc. KI, Inc. shall have the right to take a physical inventory to ascertain or verify such inventory and statement and refusal by Diplomat to submit to such physical inventory by KI, Inc. shall forfeit Diplomat's right to dispose of such inventory, KI, Inc. retaining all other legal and equitable rights KI, Inc. may have under the circumstances.\n\n            16. Disposal of Stock Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the termination of the license, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Diplomat may dispose of products covered by this Agreement which are on hand, or in process at the time notice of termination is received, for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of termination, provided advances and royalties with respect to that period are paid and statements are furnished for that period in accordance with paragraph 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Diplomat shall not manufacture, sell or dispose of any products covered by this license after (a) the expiration of the license, or (b) the termination of the license based on (i) the failure of Diplomat to affix notice of copyright, trademark or service mark registration or any other notice to the products, cartons, containers, or packing or wrapping material or advertising, promotional or display material, or (ii) because of the departure by Diplomat from the quality and style approved by KI, Inc. pursuant to paragraph 9.\n\n            17. Effect of Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the expiration or termination of this license, all rights granted to Diplomat hereunder shall forthwith revert to KI, Inc., who shall be free to license others to use KI's name in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the products covered hereby, and Diplomat will refrain from further use of KI's name or any further reference to it, direct or indirect, or anything deemed by KI, Inc. to be similar to the KI's name, in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of Diplomat's products, except as provided in paragraph 17.\n\n                                       10\n\n            18. KI, Inc.'s Remedies.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat acknowledges that (except as otherwise provided       herein) its failure to commence in good faith to manufacture and       distribute in commercial quantities any one or more of the products listed       in subparagraph 2(a) within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement       and to continue during the term hereof to diligently and continuously       manufacture, distribute and sell the products covered by this Agreement,       or any class or category thereof, will result in immediate damages to KI,       Inc.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat also acknowledges that (except as otherwise       provided herein) its failure to cease the manufacture, sale or       distribution of the products covered by this Agreement, or any class or       category thereof, at the termination or expiration of this Agreement will       result in immediate and irremediable damage to KI, Inc. and to the rights       of any subsequent licensee. Diplomat acknowledges and admits that there is       no adequate remedy at law for such failure to cease manufacture, sale or       distribution, and Diplomat agrees that in the event of such failure KI,       Inc. shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary and       permanent injunctions and such other further relief as any court with       jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\n\n                  (c) Resort to any remedies herein shall not be construed as a       waiver of any other rights and remedies to which KI, Inc. is entitled       under this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n            19. Excuse for Nonperformance.\n\n            Diplomat shall be released from its obligations hereunder and this license shall terminate in the event that governmental regulations or other\n\n\n\n\n\ncauses arising out of a state of national emergency, war, or causes beyond the control of the parties render performance impossible and one party so informs the other in writing of such causes and its desire to be so released. In such events, all royalties on sales theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            20. No Joint Venture.\n\n            Nothing herein contained shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of partners or joint venturers, and Diplomat shall have no power to obligate or bind KI, Inc. in any manner whatsoever.\n\n            21. No Assignment or Sublicense by Diplomat.\n\n            This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are personal to Diplomat and shall not, without the written consent of KI, Inc., be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise encumbered by Diplomat or by operation of law.\n\n                                       11\n\n            KI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.\n\n            22. No Waiver, Etc.\n\n            None of the terms of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by an express Agreement in writing signed by both parties. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those contained in this Agreement, which represents the entire understanding of the parties. The failure of either party hereto to enforce, or the delay by either party in enforcing, any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a modification thereof and either party may, within the time provided by applicable law, commence appropriate legal proceedings to enforce any or all of such rights. No person, firm, group or corporation (whether included in KI's name or otherwise) other than Diplomat and KI, Inc. shall be deemed to have acquired any rights by reason of anything contained in this Agreement, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 22.\n\n            23. Additional Endorsers. If, during the term of this Agreement, Diplomat should utilize the services of any other person to endorse its products, and the public image of such person is so inconsistent with that of KI as to risk damaging the good will of KI's name should KI, Inc. continue to do business with Diplomat, then KI, Inc. shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, subject to the remedial and other provisions of paragraph 14 of this Agreement.\n\n            24. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\n                  (a) Authority. KI, Inc. has the full right, power, legal       capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of KI, to       carry out its terms, and to grant Diplomat the rights, licenses and       privileges granted in this Agreement.\n\n                  (b) Merger. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior       written or oral agreements between the parties.\n\n                  (c) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and       construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without       regard to conflict of law principles.\n\n                  (d) Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing party in any proceeding       brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to       recover the reasonable fees and costs of its counsel, plus all other costs       of such proceeding.\n\n                  (e) Notices. All notices and statements to be given, payments       to be made and materials to be submitted under this Agreement shall be       given, made and submitted via certified or registered mail, postage       prepaid, return\n\n                                       12\n\n      receipt requested, at the addresses of the parties, as set forth above,       unless notification of a change of address is given in writing, and the       date of mailing shall be deemed the date the notice or statement is given.\n\n            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first set forth above.\n\n                                    /s/ Kathy Ireland                                                        ---------------------------------                                     KATHY IRELAND, Individually                                                                                                               KATHY IRELAND, INC.
