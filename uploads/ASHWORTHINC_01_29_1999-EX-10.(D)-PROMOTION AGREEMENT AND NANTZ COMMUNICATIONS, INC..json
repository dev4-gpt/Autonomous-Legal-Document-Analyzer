Nantz Communications and Nantz acknowledge that the Services to be rendered by Nantz Communications and Nantz are unique and personal.  Accordingly, except as otherwise expressly provided below, neither Nantz Communications nor Nantz shall assign any of their respective rights or delegate any of their respective duties or obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of the Company.  Nothing herein shall prevent Nantz Communications from assigning the monetary benefits of this Agreement as it may so desire.  Further, inasmuch as it is recognized that Nantz Communications is the representative of Nantz, Nantz Communications may at any time assign this Agreement to Nantz and, in such event, Nantz Communications shall have no further obligation or liability in connection herewith and Nantz Communications' position vis-a'-vis the Company in connection herewith shall be in all respects the same as if Nantz Communications had signed this Agreement as agent rather than as a principal from the beginning.
