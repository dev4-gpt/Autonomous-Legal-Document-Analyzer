Schedule A attached hereto outlines the credit and financial          review procedures and standards currently used by NPC.

NPC shall          keep NCB's senior management advised of any material changes in the          credit and financial review procedures and standards and of any          material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from          time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall          not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee          has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the          relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such          changes or exceptions. NPC also shall continue to advise senior          management officials of NCB on a timely basis with respect to any          substantial loss (meaning any loss of $1,000,000 or more with respect          to a single Merchant or $3,000,000 or more in the aggregate in any          twelve month period) incurred by NPC as a result of any financial          failures or fraud by its merchant customers. If NCB's senior management          officials reasonably determine from time to time that any changes are          needed in NPC's credit and financial review procedures and standards or          in the implementation thereof in order to avoid any significant          increase in NPC's losses from financial failures or fraud by its          merchant customers, then NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC          and NCB shall mutually agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate          changes.\n\n               (c) DUE DILIGENCE BY NCB FOR NPC PRICING STANDARDS. Senior          management officials of NPC have met with senior management officials          of NCB and have discussed with the NCB officials the pricing procedures          and standards used for Merchants as customers for Merchant Processing          Services. NPC shall keep NCB's senior management advised of any\n\n\n\n\n\n      material changes in its pricing procedures and standards and of any          material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from          time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall          not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee          has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the          relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such          changes or exceptions. If NCB's senior management officials reasonably          determine from time to time that any changes are needed in NPC's          pricing procedures and standards or in the implementation thereof, then          NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC and NCB shall mutually          agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate changes.\n\n                 ARTICLE II - AUTHORITY OF JOINT OFFICERS                     ----------------------------------------\n\n               2.1 JOINT OFFICERS.

Such exceptions occur primarily when NPC acquires another          processor's customer base or when NPC enters into a processing          agreement with an ISO/MSP which maintains merchant customers engaged in          such businesses.          - Telemarketing (In-bound or out-bound)\n\n\n\n\n\n      - Pawn Shops          - Door-to-Door Sales          - Massage Parlors          - Bail & Bond Payments          - Business operated out of Residence          - Flea Markets          - Fulfillment Houses          - Timesharing          - Travel Clubs/Packages\n\n2.
