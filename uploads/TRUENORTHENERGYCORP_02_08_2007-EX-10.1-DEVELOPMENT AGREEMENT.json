ARTICLE II DRILLING AND COMPLETING THE INITIAL WELL\n\n2.1   BP has commenced drilling operations for the Initial Well, and, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, BP shall continue drilling the Initial Well with due diligence to the Objective Zone and perform all logging and testing operations to which the Parties agree. Company shall pay 11.67% of the Drilling Costs of the Initial Well, regardless of whether the Initial Well is successfully drilled to the Objective Zone. BP has estimated that Drilling Costs will be approximately FOURTEEN MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($14,862,000) (the \"Estimated Drilling Costs\") for the Initial Well. Company shall pay its share of Estimated Drilling Costs, being ONE MILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS ($1,734,395), at execution of this Agreement via wire transfer according to the wiring instructions set forth in Exhibit \"I\", but Company will pay its share of actual Drilling Costs in accordance with this Article II and Section 5.4.\n\n2.2  When and if Casing Point is reached in the Initial Well, BP shall give written notice to Company of such occurrence, and such notice shall state whether BP proposes to attempt to Complete the Initial Well as a producer, whether in the Objective Zone or in a shallower Zone, or to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole. The notice shall be accompanied by all well information and data set forth in Exhibit \"D\" (the \"Well Information\"), unless such information has been previously furnished to Company.\n\n  (A) If BP reaches Casing Point and proposes to Complete the Initial Well as a producer, whether in the Objective Zone or in a shallower Zone, such notice shall also include a completion AFE. The completion AFE shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of Completion Costs for the Initial Well. Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.\n\n  (B) If BP reaches Casing Point and proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3  If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company timely elects to participate in such Completion attempt in accordance with Section 2.2(A), Company shall pay 8.75% of the Completion Costs associated with the Initial Well and 8.75% of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment associated with the Initial Well beyond the wellhead connections (including but not limited to stock tanks, separators, treaters, pumping equipment, piping, and metering devices).   2.4  If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate in such Completion attempt, or is deemed not to participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such operation and carry Company's proportionate part of Completion Costs. If the Completion attempt is ultimately not successful, BP shall abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6 or propose to Complete the Initial Well in another Zone under the provisions of Section 2.2 (and Company shall be given another election to participate in such newly proposed Completion). If the Completion attempt results in the production of oil and/or gas in paying quantities, the Initial Well shall be operated by BP at the expense and for the account of BP and other parties who agreed to participate in the Completion attempt. By electing not to participate in any Completion attempt, or being deemed not to participate in any Completion attempt, Company shall be deemed to have relinquished to BP, and BP shall own and be entitled to receive, all of Company's interest in the Initial Well and share of production therefrom until the proceeds of the sale of such share, calculated at the well, or market value thereof if such share is not sold (after deducting applicable ad valorem, production, severance, windfall profits, and excise taxes, royalty, overriding royalty and other interests payable out of or measured by the production from the Initial Well accruing with respect to such interest until it reverts), shall equal the total of the following:\n\n  (A) twenty six and one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the Completion Costs associated with the Initial Well and twenty six and one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment beyond the wellhead connections (including but not limited to stock tanks, separators, treaters, pumping equipment, piping and metering devices) (i.e., 300% non-consent penalty on a non-promoted basis); and\n\n  (B) eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) of the cost of operation of the Initial Well commencing with first production and continuing until Company's interest shall revert to it in accordance with this Section 2.4 (i.e., 100% non-consent penalty on a non-promoted basis).\n\n2.5  Company shall bear its proportionate part, being eight and three quarters percent (8.75%), of any severance, production and gathering taxes and any other taxes imposed or measured by the volume or value of production from the Initial Well, including, but only by way of illustration, excise taxes and windfall profit taxes, whether enacted by federal, state or local authority.\n\n2.6  The Initial Well shall be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations and at the cost, risk and expense of the parties who participated in the cost of drilling the Initial Well. Company's proportionate share of the cost, risk and expense to plug and abandon the Initial Well shall be eight and three quarters percent (8.75%).   ARTICLE III SUBSTITUTE WELLS\n\n3.1   If, prior to reaching Casing Point in the Initial Well, BP should encounter geological or mechanical conditions which render further operations impracticable or economically infeasible, in the sole reasonable opinion of BP, BP shall (i) give written notice of such occurrence to Company, and (ii) such notice shall state whether BP proposes to attempt to Complete the Initial Well in a shallower Zone or to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (A) If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well without reaching the Objective Zone, such notice shall also include a completion AFE. The completion AFE shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of Completion Costs for the Initial Well. Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well. If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate in such Completion attempt, or is deemed not to participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such operation and carry Company's proportionate part of Completion Costs in accordance with Section 2.4.\n\n  (B) If BP proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.\n\n3.2  If BP does not drill the Initial Well to the Objective Zone, Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, for a period of one (1) year from the date the drilling rig used to drill the Initial Well is removed from the well site location for the Initial Well (the \"Rig Release Date\"), to participate in the drilling of a Substitute Well. BP shall have no obligation to drill a Substitute Well, and Company shall have no right to propose a Substitute Well. If and when BP elects to drill a Substitute Well, BP shall provide Company with an AFE for the Substitute Well. The AFE for the Substitute Well shall include, at a minimum, the surface and bottomhole location of the Substitute Well, the Objective Zone, and the estimated costs for the Substitute Well as a dry hole and as a producer. Company shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such written notice to elect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Substitute Well.\n\n3.3  If BP proposes to drill a Substitute Well and Company timely elects to participate in such Substitute Well in accordance with Section 3.2, such Substitute Well shall be treated for all purposes herein as the Initial Well (including, but not limited to, Company's obligation to pay 11.67% of the Drilling Costs for such Substitute Well), except that the Objective Zone for such Substitute Well shall be governed by the AFE for such Substitute Well.\n\n3.4  If Company elects not to participate in a Substitute Well, or is deemed not to participate in a Substitute Well, this Agreement shall terminate except as provided in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.\n\nARTICLE IV EARNING RIGHTS\n\n4.1  When and if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP shall assign to Company, by partial assignment in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\"(the \"Partial Assignment\"), an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) working interest in the Initial Well and an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) interest in the BP Interests.   4.2  If the Initial Well is not drilled to the Objective Zone, for any reason, but the Initial Well is successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP shall assign to Company, by partial assignment in the form of the Partial Assignment, an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) working interest in the Initial Well and an undivided eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) interest in the BP Interests, but limited as to the geographic boundaries of the Unit in which the Initial Well is located and further limited as to those depths between the surface and the stratigraphic equivalent of the deepest Zone penetrated in the Initial Well (the \"Partial Interest\"). BP and Company shall conduct operations with respect to such Initial Well as if they have entered into the Operating Agreement until such well or a Substitute Well is drilled to and successfully Completed in the Objective Zone or until this Agreement is terminated; provided, however, if this Agreement is to be terminated without Company earning its proportionate share of the BP Interests in accordance with Section 4.1, then the Parties shall enter into an operating agreement in the form of the Operating Agreement except that the contract area of such operating agreement shall be limited to the Partial Interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V JOINT OPERATIONS\n\n5.1   BP does not own but has a limited non-exclusive right to use the Data in accordance with the Seismic Use Agreements. Under the Seismic Use Agreements, BP may not sell, assign, copy, transfer, display, exhibit or in any way reveal the Data, except as authorized by and in compliance with the provisions of the Seismic Use Agreements. Therefore, Company's access to the Data shall be limited, and may be prohibited all together upon execution of this Agreement, unless Company obtains the consent or otherwise enters into a seismic license or seismic use agreement with the Data Owner. BP does not represent or warrant in any way, and expressly disclaims any representations or warranties, of any kind, express, implied or otherwise, that it owns the Data or otherwise has the right to provide all or any portion of the Data to Company.\n\n5.2  BP shall deliver to Company the Well Information derived from or attributable to the Initial Well and any Substitute Well and Additional Well, if such Well Information is acquired, obtained, or performed by BP.\n\n5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the exclusive control of BP and the operation thereof shall be conducted in a prudent and workmanlike manner. BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice, and in compliance with applicable law and regulation, but in no event shall BP have any liability to Company for losses sustained or liabilities or obligations incurred except such as may result from BP's gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n5.4  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, BP shall promptly pay and discharge expenses incurred in drilling the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well pursuant to this Agreement and shall charge Company with its proportionate shares upon the expense basis provided in Exhibit \"C\" to the Operating Agreement, whether or not such Operating Agreement has been executed by the Parties. BP shall keep an accurate record, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, showing expenses incurred and charges and credits made and received.\n\n5.5  When and if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP and Company shall enter into an operating agreement attached hereto as Exhibit \"F\" (the \"Operating Agreement\") covering the Contract Area. The Operating Agreement shall be executed contemporaneously with the Partial Assignment but shall be effective on October 1, 2006. The Operating Agreement shall apply to all Additional Wells. In the event of any conflict between the Operating Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.\n\n5.6  Unless Company elects by thirty (30) days' prior written notice to BP either to take in kind or to separately dispose of its share of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons, BP shall in good faith, to the extent it can do so, cause Company's share of production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Wells to be marketed and sold to either a Third Party or to an Affiliate of BP in a commercially reasonable manner, which terms shall not be less than on the same terms and conditions as BP's share of production from such wells are sold. It is recognized by the Parties that BP, or its predecessor, has provided at its cost or made arrangements with Third Parties to provide certain facilities beyond the wellhead (the \"Plants\") needed for producing, storing, separating, gathering, treating, processing and delivering production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well. It is agreed that BP will continue to make the Plants (as they or any contractual arrangements related thereto may be modified, changed or upgraded) proportionately available to handle BP, Company and Third Party production from the Contract Area. It is understood that a proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the Plants, including depreciation or rental in lieu of depreciation and actual Third Party costs, whether on a cash fee basis or on a retained volume basis, will be allocated to the Parties on a \"throughput\" basis (being that portion of such costs relating to the production volumes from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well, as each may bear to the total production volumes handled by the Plants, including any Third Party or BP volumes not produced from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well). Nothing herein shall be construed to impart, transfer or convey any ownership interest in the Plants to Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7  If any lands within the Contract Area (other than those lands covered by the Leases) contain an interest which is unleased or leased to a Third Party and such interest must be carried in order to conduct operations consistent with this Agreement (such Third Party interest being a \"Carried Interest\"), Company shall bear eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) of the Carried Interests in order to conduct such operations.\n\n5.8  At all times while this Agreement is in effect, Company shall carry insurance of the types and in the minimum amounts set forth in Exhibit \"G\". All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against BP.\n\nARTICLE VI TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n6.1  Except as provided in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5, this Agreement shall terminate one (1) year from the Rig Release Date, if such has not been terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions hereof.\n\n6.2  Notwithstanding Section 6.1, if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, this Agreement shall continue for so long as the Operating Agreement remains in full force and effect.\n\n6.3   Notwithstanding Section 6.1, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for so long as Company participates in the drilling of a Substitute Well in accordance with Section 3.2.\n\n6.4  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Company earns a Partial Interest in the Initial Well and the BP Interests pursuant to Section 4.2, the Parties shall first enter into an operating agreement in the form of the Operating Agreement, except that the contract area of such operating agreement shall be limited to the Partial Interest, prior to termination of this Agreement.\n\n6.5  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not release any of the Parties from any obligation or liability which accrued prior to such expiration or termination (including the costs to plug and abandon the Initial Well and any Substitute Wells and Additional Wells) or which, by the terms hereof, is intended to survive such expiration or termination, including but not limited to Articles I, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI and Sections 5.1 and 5.6, which terms shall survive indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII ASSIGNMENT; PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS\n\n7.1   The rights and obligations created by this Agreement may not be assigned by Company, in whole or in part, without first obtaining BP's written consent under this Agreement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If BP consents to an assignment by Company of all or part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, it is nevertheless understood and agreed that any such consent shall not relieve Company of its primary liability for the performance of and compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, and shall not have the effect nor be construed to have the effect of waiving this limitation as to future, further, or additional assignments. Any assignment of the rights and obligations under this Agreement by Company without the consent of BP shall be voidable by BP.\n\n7.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement, including the Operating Agreement, should Company desire to sell all or any part of its interest in the Initial Well, the BP Interests, or any Substitute Well or Additional Well, Company shall promptly give written notice to BP, with full information concerning its proposed disposition, which shall include the name and address of the prospective transferee (who must be ready, willing and able to purchase), the purchase price, a legal description sufficient to identify the property, and all other terms of the offer.
