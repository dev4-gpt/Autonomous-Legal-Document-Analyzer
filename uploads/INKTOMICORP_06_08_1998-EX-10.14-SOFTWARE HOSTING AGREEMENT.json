Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Microsoft will not be obligated to make any payments to Inktomi pursuant to clauses (a), (e) and/or (f) of Section 4.1 below if Microsoft exercises its rights to move the Hosting Servers under this Section 2.6.2.\n\n          2.7  Inktomi will assign two (2) full-time Inktomi employees exclusively dedicated to maintenance duties hereunder. Such employees are identified in Exhibit D attached hereto; and their replacements shall be subject to Microsoft's prior written approval (which approval Microsoft will not unreasonably withhold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft and Inktomi mutually agree in writing, additional Inktomi employees may be required to be assigned to maintenance duties hereunder.\n\n                                       5\n\n            2.8  Microsoft acknowledges that Inktomi has customized and provided, and will continue to customize and provide, its software and technology to other parties for use in connection with a variety of applications, including search engine applications. Except as may be expressly provided to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to (i) limit or restrict Inktomi from customizing and providing its software and technology to other parties for any purpose, including in connection with search engine applications, or (ii) in any way affect the rights granted to such other parties.

Prior to purchasing any such new Hosting Servers, Inktomi will seek bids from third parties, copies of which Inktomi will provide\n\n\n\n\n\nto Microsoft, and Microsoft will have the right to approve all such purchases and the applicable purchase prices. Inktomi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the purchase prices of such new Hosting Servers, but in any event such purchase prices will not be more than any comparable equipment purchased by Inktomi during the same time frame. Inktomi will consult with Microsoft regarding the proposed purchase prices of all new Hosting Servers prior to purchasing the same, and if Microsoft is aware of a vendor who is willing to sell Hosting Servers to Inktomi at a lower purchase price than as proposed by Inktomi, Inktomi agrees to purchase the applicable new Hosting Servers from such vendor.\n\n               3.1.2  Notwithstanding Section 3.1.1 above, Inktomi shall have no obligation whatsoever to purchase any new Hosting Servers unless Microsoft loans Inktomi an amount equal to the purchase price thereof pursuant to the Loan Agreement between Inktomi and Microsoft of even date herewith (the \"Loan Agreement\").\n\n          3.2  Microsoft acknowledges that, pursuant to Inktomi's contractual arrangement with its subcontractor, Exodus Communications, Inc. (\"Exodus\"), Inktomi will locate the Hosting Servers at the facilities of Exodus, and Exodus will provide power and Internet telecommunications services to the Hosting Servers. However, Microsoft will have no obligations or liabilities to Exodus, Inktomi will remain liable for providing all\n\n                                       6\n\n  Services to Microsoft notwithstanding its arrangement with Exodus, and Inktomi will [*] and [*] against from any and all [*] to [*] (in accordance with the procedures specified in Section [*] below). A copy of the contract(s) between Inktomi and Exodus is/are attached hereto as Exhibit [*], and Inktomi shall not modify said contract(s) or replace Exodus as its subcontractor for the applicable services (including without limitation by having Inktomi perform the Services directly) without Microsoft's prior written approval (which approval Microsoft agrees to not unreasonably withhold). Inktomi shall provide Exodus with a copy of the Security Measures applicable under this Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Exodus strictly adheres to all such Security Measures.\n\n          3.3  Subject to Microsoft's rights under Section 2.6.2 above and/or the Security Agreement between Inktomi and Microsoft of even date herewith, executed in accordance with the Loan Agreement, Microsoft shall not have any access to the Hosting Servers, except as follows: (i) Microsoft will have electronic read-only access to \"real time\" system data on the status of the usage, accessibility and performance of the Microsoft Search Engine (via software developed by Inktomi in consultation with Microsoft), and (ii) Microsoft will have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to have representatives escorted by Inktomi employees tour the premises where the Hosting Servers are located as necessary to ensure Microsoft's satisfaction with the operation of the physical plant and equipment. Microsoft agrees to comply with the Security Measures at all times when accessing the Hosting Servers as permitted hereunder.\n\n     4.

OVERVIEW ================================================================================\n\nThe goal of this document is to provide a reasonably complete list of Yukon requirements for the Inktomi search service.  Note that a number of the requirements in this document are met by the existing search service but are included anyway for the sake of completeness.\n\nThe Section 2 lists all requirements according to area (Performance and Scalability, Reliability and Fault Tolerance, ...) together with information on Target Release and Due Date as defined below.  The Appendix (Section 7) follows a similar organization and provides more detail on the requirements..\n\n[*]\n\n                                                                    Page 1 of 32\n\n[*]=CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY  WITH THE COMMISSION.

Upon satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent, this Software  Hosting Agreement shall be deemed terminated pursuant to Section 10.1. Upon  expiration of the Transition Period, all rights granted to Microsoft to use the  Product (other than Microsoft Technology, Joint Derivative Technology and the  Microsoft Derivative Technology) and/or any Inktomi Technology under the  transitional license referred to in clause (iv) or otherwise shall cease, and  Microsoft shall immediately return to Inktomi all Confidential Materials (and all copies thereof), provided however that, notwithstanding any provision of the Ancillary Agreements to the contrary, the undertaking by Inktomi to indemnify Microsoft and hold it harmless against Taxes as provided in clause (ii) above shall survive any such terminations.\n\n                                      25"
