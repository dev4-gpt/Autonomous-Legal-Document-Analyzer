If Licensee fails to reach the Market Penetration Targets Fox shall in its sole discretion have the right to terminate Licensee's exclusivity under this Agreement. In the event of termination of Licensee's exclusivity for Licensee's failure to achieve the Market Penetration Targets, Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products which have been developed by Licensee prior to such termination, without first obtaining a license from Licensee on terms to be mutually agreed in each party's reasonable discretion, for the exploitation of the Licensee Materials.\n\n(2) Targeted Releases: Fox acknowledges that Licensee may not be able to secure placement of all Targeted Releases at the levels set forth for the Market Penetration Targets defined in the previous sub-Paragraph.

Licensee further acknowledges and agrees that pursuant to the VGSL Agreement and the T-Mobile Agreement, VGSL and T-Mobile will remit directly to Fox all receipts generated from sales of the Wireless Products to VGSL and T-Mobile subscribers. Fox will pass through all such receipts received from VGSL and T-Mobile to Licensee and such receipts shall be treated as Gross Receipts, as defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below, for the purpose of this Agreement.

Fox and Licensee will cooperate together in good faith, on a schedule to be mutually agreed, to jointly manage the VGSL and T-Mobile relationships with respect to the Wireless Products, subject to willingness on the parts of VGSL and T-Mobile to so cooperate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any conversations undertaken between Fox and VGSL and/or T-Mobile without Licensee's participation shall not be a breach of this provision.\n\n(A) Non-Exclusive CSP Distribution in VGSL Territories: Under no circumstances shall Licensee enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with a CSP other than VGSL in the following territories (\"VGSL Territories\") covered under the VGSL Agreement: (1) United Kingdom; (2) Ireland; (3) Germany; (4) Spain; (5) France; (6) Sweden; (7) Switzerland; (8) Portugal; (9) Netherlands; (10) Greece; (11) Italy; (12) Australia; (13) New Zealand; (14) Egypt; (15) Slovenia; (16) Belgium; (17) Austria; (18) Hungary; (19) Malta; (20) Croatia; (21) South Africa; and (22) Japan.\n\n(iii) Japan Distribution: Upon Fox's notice to Licensee, Licensee shall cease immediately some or all distribution of the Wireless Products in Japan. In the event Fox provides such termination notice to Licensee, Licensee hereby grants Fox a license to the Licensee Materials in order for Fox to distribute the Wireless Products that Licensee has developed for distribution in Japan prior to such termination, either directly or through a third-party. In consideration of such license, Fox shall pay Licensee a royalty as set forth in Paragraph 7(b)(i) below.\n\n(iv) Unless otherwise mutually agreed between Fox and Licensee, Licensee will require each Licensed CSP to distribute Wireless Products to end users only for the payment of a fee; provided that Licensee may permit limited distribution (i.e. one Wireless Product per Property in each category of Wireless Products and including only one game level for each game) of Wireless Products without a fee for promotional or marketing purposes. The fees will typically appear on the end user's Wireless Platform bill and be remitted by the end user to the CSP pursuant to an agreement between the end user and the CSP. The CSP will in turn remit fees to Licensee (less any Deductions as that term is defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below) pursuant to an agreement between Licensee and the CSP. Licensee will then remit royalties to Fox in accordance with Paragraph 7, below.\n\n3.

If Licensee intends to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, it must submit a bid in response to Fox's request within 10 business days. If Licensee does submit a bid, both parties shall negotiate in good faith over the bid for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 additional business days. If the parties have not reached agreement in writing regarding the terms and conditions for the exploitation of the Opportunity within said time period, or if Licensee fails to submit a bid in a timely manner, Fox shall be free to accept any bid from any other party with respect to the Opportunity, or Fox shall be free not to exploit the Opportunity at all. Should Licensee choose to exercise its Right of First Negotiation, its floor bid shall be at least US$***** for each Major Release (as defined in Exhibit N).\n\n5. ADVANCE: Licensee shall pay Fox a non-refundable recoupable advance in the amount of US$***** upon Licensee's signature of this Agreement (the \"Advance\").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that either party (A) fails to pay Royalties or other amounts when due, or (B) fails to make Royalty or other accountings in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the breaching party shall be subject to a one-time cure period of fifteen (15) days for such breach. If a party fails to cure the breach within such fifteen (15)-day period or another breach of either (A) or (B) above occurs following an initial cure within the fifteen (15)-day period, then the other party shall have the right in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period.\n\n      (vii) Other Agreements: Should any event of default by Licensee cause Fox to terminate this Agreement, Fox, in its sole discretion, may terminate, without any cure period, any other agreements concurrently existing between Fox and Licensee upon written notice specifying the agreements to be terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, this remedy shall only apply to any agreements concurrently existing between the specific parties to this Agreement and shall not apply to agreements between Licensee and Fox Sports.\n\n    (b) Effect of Termination/Expiration: In the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall: (i) immediately stop in all respects the sale and distribution of the Wireless Products and provide Fox with a complete inventory report and accounting with\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-23-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    payment of all Royalties, and (ii) at Fox's election shall either (A) deliver to Fox all materials related to the Wireless Products or (B) give Fox satisfactory evidence of their destruction. Licensee agrees that its failure to stop in all respects the sale and/or distribution of the Wireless Products upon termination or expiration of the Agreement will result in immediate irreparable damage to Fox for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and in the event of such failure by Licensee, Fox shall be entitled to injunctive relief. Fox's exercise of any of the foregoing remedies shall not operate as a waiver of any other rights or remedies which Fox may have. Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products after the termination or expiration of this Agreement without obtaining from Licensee a separate license to the Licensee Materials.\n\n(i) Sell-Off Period: Notwithstanding Paragraph 15(b), in the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall have a period of ***** from the date of such termination (unless such termination occurs less than ***** prior to the expiration of this Agreement in which case the time period shall be shortened accordingly so as not to exceed the date of expiration) in which to sell-off existing inventory of Wireless Products already in the Distribution Channels (\"Sell Off Period\"). Licensee agrees that no additional Wireless Products may be developed or distributed during the Sell Off Period and Licensee agrees to require that any Licensed CSP to comply with this provision. Upon the expiration of the Sell Off Period, Licensee agrees to destroy all such remaining inventory and confirm same in writing to Fox (and require that any Licensed CSP do the same). Any revenues, credits or other consideration received by Licensee for the Wireless Products during the Sell Off Period will be subject to Licensee's obligation to pay Fox Royalties pursuant to Paragraph 7 above.\n\n(ii) Fox's Development of Wireless Products: In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement or Licensee's loss of exclusive rights under this Agreement, Fox shall be free to create and exploit, or have a third party create or exploit, wireless products which may be similar to those developed and distributed by Licensee pursuant to this Agreement for the Properties.\n\n    (c) Guarantee Forfeiture: In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limitation of Fox's rights and remedies all of which are expressly reserved, the following payment penalties shall apply: (i) if termination occurs in the first year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining Guarantee, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****), and any Guarantee payments made in excess of ***** dollars ($*****) shall be refunded by Fox to Licensee; and (ii) if termination occurs in the second year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining portion of the Guarantee then unpaid, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****). Any forfeited Guarantees will apply as a set off against any additional damages claimed by Fox.\n\n16.

The businesses of News America and its subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., include: the production and distribution of motion pictures, television programming and related consumer products (Twentieth Century Fox); television and cable broadcasting (the Fox Network, Fox owned television stations, Fox Sports Net, Fox Sports World, Fox Sports World Espa\u0148ol, Speedvision, Fox News Channel, FX and Fox Movie Channel); the publication of newspapers, books, magazines and promotional free-standing inserts (The New York Post, HarperCollins Publishers, The Weekly Standard and News America Marketing); sports franchises (the Los Angeles Dodgers); and marketing services (SmartSource/iGroup). In this Statement of Privacy Principles these businesses are collectively called the News America Group. At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort. This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group's U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice.* The News America Group is actively involved in the ongoing privacy debate and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology.\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nThe News America Group obtains personally identifiable information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personally identifiable information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services. When the News America Group obtains personally identifiable information from third-party sources, we use only reputable sources. In those instances where our information collection activities involve children, the News America Group provides special privacy protections.\n\nNOTICE\n\nWhen The News America Group collects personally identifiable information from consumers, we inform them about who is collecting the information, why it is being collected, how it is being collected, the types of uses we will make of the information, whether we will disclose the information to third parties and the types of third parties to whom we will disclose the information, and consumers' options regarding the use of their information.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-45-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOICE\n\nThe News America Group provides consumers with an opportunity to choose whether the business unit that collects their personally identifiable information may use it for purposes that are other than those for which the information was submitted, and whether the information may be shared with third parties.\n\nUSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nInside the News America Group, we use personally identifiable information only in a manner consistent with these Privacy Principles. Personally identifiable information is available only to our employees, agents and contractors who have a business reason to have access to such information. The News America Group uses personally identifiable information to respond to our customers and to make decisions about the goods and services that the News America Group or its business partners provide or hope to provide to consumers. Subject to the exercise of consumer choice, personally identifiable information may be used for different purposes, or shared with our business partners. A News America Group business entity may disclose personally identifiable information without providing consumers with a choice in order to protect the rights of the companies within the News America Group or their respective employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to web sites operated by News America Group companies; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if a News America Group entity sells all or part of one of its businesses, makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a business merger or transfer, personally identifiable information may be transferred to a third party as part of that transaction.\n\nSECURITY\n\nThe News America Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.\n\nACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION\n\nWhenever possible, each News America Group business unit permits consumers to have a right to see the personally identifiable information that it has collected from them, to correct any information that is incorrect and to instruct the business unit to delete the information from its files.\n\nREMEDIES\n\nConsumers may contact a privacy officer at each News America Group business unit regarding privacy complaints and disputes.\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nEach News America Group company will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with these Privacy Principles.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-46-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT Q\n\nLICENSEE COMPETITORS\n\nJamdat Mforma Digital Bridges Digital Chocolate Game Loft Infospace\n\nAny further additions and/or deletions shall be mutually agreed and addressed via amendment to this Agreement.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-47-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007"
