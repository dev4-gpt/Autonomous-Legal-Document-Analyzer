The extent of the approvals to be sought from                         the drivers  and other Team  members  shall  include the                         right to use their name,  likeness,  approved  biography                         and  sobriquet in  connection  with such  marketing  and                         promotional materials.\n\n     2. Other Rights of XC. During the Term of this Agreement, XC shall have the right to identify  itself  with the Team and to  identify  itself as an official \"technology  sponsor for  wearable  computers\"  of the Team in any  promotional, marking or other materials used by XC.\n\n     3. Consideration to AJR; Registration Rights.\n\n          (a) In  consideration of the rights granted to XC pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 hereof and the provisions of this  Agreement,  XC shall issue to AJR (i) 125,000  shares  (the  \"Shares\")  of common  stock,  par value  $0.01 of XC (the \"Common  Stock\");  and (ii)  warrants to purchase  50,000 shares of Common Stock (the  \"Warrants\").  The Warrants shall have an exercise price of $1.18 per share being the closing  market price for the Common Stock on April 30, 2002 and shall be exercisable for a period of three (3) years from their date of issue.\n\n          (b) In  addition  to the  Shares  and  Warrants  to be  issued  to AJR pursuant to Section 3(a)  hereof,  XC agrees to provide to AJR five (5) to eight (8) (as  determined by XC in its  discretion)  MAV(R)  wearable  computers  (the \"Units\") to be used by AJR to promote XC's products and services as contemplated by Section 1(c)(v). AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement, except to the extent such damage  or loss  results  from the  intentional  abuse of the  equipment  by AJR personnel.\n\n          (c) XC shall provide a link from its website to AJR's website.\n\n          (d) XC  hereby  grants to AJR  \"piggyback\"  registration  rights  with respect to the Shares and the shares of Common  Stock  underlying  the  Warrants (collectively,  the  \"Registrable  Securities\").  Pursuant  to such  \"piggyback\" registration  rights, XC shall include all of the Registrable  Securities in any registration  statement filed by XC with respect to its Common Stock (other than on a  registration  statement  on Forms  S-8 or S-4 (or any  successors  to such forms) or relating to any employee  stock option plan) with the  Securities  and Exchange Commission.  In the event a registration  statement covering all of the Registrable  Securities  has\n\n                                      -3-\n\nnot been filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on or before July 1, 2002, XC agrees to pay to AJR $10,000. XC shall pay to AJR an additional $10,000 for each thirty-day  period  thereafter  (e.g.,  ending,  August 1, September 1, etc.) in which a  registration  statement has not been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of registering all Registrable  Securities. All such  payments  due  hereunder  shall be payable on or before the 5th of the month in which such payment  becomes due. In the event XC voluntarily  withdraws any registration  statement submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, XC shall be deemed to have  never  submitted  such  registration  statement  for purposes of this paragraph.  Unless  otherwise agreed by XC and AJR, none of the\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrable  Securities shall be sold as part of an underwritten public offering in connection with the registration  statement filed pursuant to this paragraph, but, instead, shall be delivered to AJR as unrestricted, freely trading Shares.\n\n          (e) All costs and expenses  associated  with the  registration  of the Registrable  Securities  shall be born by  XC.AJR  shall  provide  XC with  such information  regarding AJR as XC shall request for inclusion in the registration statement  and shall  indemnify the Company and hold it harmless with respect to any material misstatement or material omission with respect to such information\n\n          (f) All Registrable Securities that are registered pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof shall be subject to the \"lock-up\"  provided for in this Section 3(f) (the  \"Lock-Up\"),  and AJR agrees to be bound by the  Lock-Up.  Pursuant  to the Lock-Up,  AJR agrees that following the registration of Registrable  Securities, it shall not directly or  indirectly,  sell,  transfer,  pledge,  assign,  gift, hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose of more than 25,000  shares of Common  Stock during  any  five  (5)  consecutive  trading  days on the  principal  securities exchange or securities market where XC's Common Stock is then traded.\n\n     4. Accredited Investor Representations.  In order to induce XC to issue the Shares and the  Warrants to AJR,  AJR hereby  represents  and  warrants to XC as follows:\n\n          (a) AJR is aware of what constitutes an \"accredited  investor\" as that term is defined under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  \"Securities  Act\"), and under applicable state securities laws, and AJR represents and warrants that is an \"accredited investor\" for purposes of Regulation D and such state securities laws.\n\n          (b) AJR acknowledges that an investment in the Shares and the Warrants is a  speculative  investment  and  involves a high degree of risk,  and that XC makes no assurances  whatsoever  concerning the present or prospective  value of the  Shares  or the  Warrants.  AJR is able to bear  the  economic  risks  of an investment in the Shares and the Warrants,  and, consequently,  without limiting the generality of the foregoing, is able to hold the Shares and the Warrants for an indefinite period of time and has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire  investment  in the Shares and the  Warrants in the event such a loss should occur.\n\n          (c) AJR has had an opportunity to review copies of XC's public filings with  the  United  States   Securities  and  Exchange   Commission  (the  \"SEC\") (collectively,  the \"Public  Documents\").  AJR has had the opportunity to obtain any additional  information  necessary to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the Public  Documents  and has been given the  opportunity  to meet with representatives of XC and to have them answer any questions and\n\n                                      -4-\n\nprovide any  additional  information  considered  relevant by AJR. In making its decision  to invest in Shares and the  Warrants,  AJR has  relied  solely on the Public Documents.\n\n          (d) AJR is acquiring the Shares and the Warrants for AJR's own account for  investment  and not with a view to or for  resale  in  connection  with any distribution  of the  Shares or the  Warrants.  AJR has not  offered or sold any portion of the Shares or the Warrants  and has no present  intention of dividing the Shares or the Warrants with others or of selling,  distributing or otherwise disposing of any portion of the Shares or the Warrants either currently or after the passage of a fixed or determinable  period of time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any predetermined event or circumstance.

AJR has not offered or sold any portion of the Shares or the Warrants and has no present  intention of dividing the Shares or the Warrants with others or of selling,  distributing or otherwise disposing of any portion of the Shares or the Warrants either currently or after the passage of a fixed or determinable period of time or upon the  occurrence or  non-occurrence  of any  predetermined event or  circumstance.  Nothing in this Section 4(d) shall limit the ability of the AJR to sell or transfer any of the Shares  following the  effectiveness of a registration  statement  concerning  the Shares in accordance  with Section 3(d) hereof.\n\n          (e) AJR  understands  that the issuance of the Shares and the Warrants has not been  registered  under the  Securities  Act and that the Shares and the Warrants have been issued in reliance upon an exemption therefrom for non-public limited offerings.  AJR acknowledges that the Shares and the Warrants constitute \"restricted  securities\"  under  the  Securities  Act and  they may not be sold, transferred,  assigned,  pledged or otherwise  disposed of, except pursuant to a registration  statement that is declared  effective under the Securities Act, or an exemption  from  registration  under the Securities Act as determined by XC's legal  counsel.  AJR  further  acknowledges  and  agrees  that XC will  place an appropriate  restrictive  legend  on the  certificates  for the  Shares  and the Warrants,  as applicable,  to comply with the Securities Act and to identify the Shares and the Warrants as \"restricted securities\".\n\n          (f) AJR further acknowledges that no United States federal (including, without  limitation,  the SEC),  or state agency or similar  agency of any other country,  has  reviewed,  approved,  passed upon or made any  recommendation  or endorsement regarding XC or the Shares or the Warrants.\n\n          (g) AJR  acknowledges  that XC is  relying  on the  accuracy  of AJR's representations  and warranties set forth in Section 4 in issuing the Shares and the Warrants to AJR.\n\n\n\n\n\n          (h)  AJR  acknowledges   that  the  certificate  for  the  Registrable Securities  shall contain such legends as XC shall consider  necessary to ensure compliance with the restrictions of the Securities Act and with the Lock-Up.\n\n     5. Term. Subject to earlier termination as provided for herein, the term of this Agreement  shall commence as of the date hereof and shall  terminate at the end of the Season which is scheduled to end on October 12, 2002 (the \"Term\").\n\n                                      -5-\n\n     6. Licensed Materials.\n\n          (a) XC does hereby  grant AJR a limited and  non-transferable  license and  non-exclusive  right to use XC's logo and  trademarks and service marks set forth on Schedule A attached hereto (the \"Licensed  Materials\")  during the Term of this Agreement.  AJR shall only be permitted to use the Licensed Materials in connection  with  the  Sponsorship  and  only in the  limited  manner  expressly permitted as set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. No other use of any of the Licensed  Materials by AJR shall be  permitted.  AJR shall not have the right to modify,  alter or change any of the Licensed  Materials.  All Licensed Materials shall remain the sole and exclusive  property of XC and AJR shall not obtain any right,  title or interest  therein.  AJR shall not have any right to sub-license any of the Licensed Materials to any third party.\n\n          (b) Upon the  termination  of this  Agreement,  AJR shall  immediately cease  using any of the  Licensed  Materials  and shall  comply with the written directions of XC in connection therewith.\n\n          (c) XC  represents  and warrants to AJR that XC has the right to grant to AJR  the  right  to use  the  Licensed  Materials  as  contemplated  by  this Agreement.\n\n          (d) AJR shall not use any of the  Licensed  Materials  to  express  or imply any  endorsement of any other sponsor of the Team by XC. AJR shall not use any of the Licensed Materials in connection with, or in any way associated with, the names, marks, trademarks,  servicemarks,  symbols, products, services, logos or proprietary designations or properties of any third party.\n\n          (e)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  herein,  AJR  and/or Porsche shall be permitted to use  photographs of the Cars,  transport  vehicles and crew uniforms containing XC logos and Licensed Materials for any promotional or marketing purposes during and forever after the term of this Agreement.\n\n     7. Reputation. AJR shall not take any action or suffer any action to occur, whether taken by the Team or others,  which could result in an adverse impact on XC, its Licensed Materials and the goodwill associated  therewith as a result of this Agreement.  Neither party shall have the right to use the corporate name of the other.\n\n     8.

AJR and XC each agrees that it shall keep the  Confidential  Information it receives from the other party hereto strictly  confidential and shall not disclose any of the Confidential  Information to any other person or entity,  or take or use any of the Confidential Information for its own purposes,  except as may be required in connection with the  performance of its  obligations  under this Agreement or the enforcement of this Agreement.

In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the other party waives compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, each of XC and AJR, as the case may be, may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that such person is  advised  by legal  counsel  in  writing  is  legally  required  to be disclosed.\n\n          (c)  Each  of XC and AJR  agree  that  money  damages  would  not be a sufficient  remedy for any breach of the  provisions  of this Section 9 and that either XC and AJR, as the case may be,  shall be entitled to  equitable  relief, including,  without  limitation,  injunctive  relief  and  specific  performance (without  being required to obtain a bond or post other security or prove actual damages),  in the  event  of  any  breach  or  threatened  breach  of any of the provisions of this Section 9 by the other party, in addition to all other rights and  remedies  available  to XC and AJR, as the case may be,  whether at law, in equity or otherwise relating to such breach.\n\n     10.

The  indemnification obligations  described  in Section  11(a),  including  all  limitations  on such obligations, shall be the exclusive remedy of the XC Indemnified Parties for any Losses  resulting from or based upon any breach by AJR of any of its agreements, covenants or obligations  hereunder or the use of any of the Licensed  Materials in a manner that is not permitted hereby.\n\n     12.

XC and AJR  shall  not be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its  obligations  hereunder which is principally the result of the occurrence of an Event of Force Majeure.  In the event of any such delay or failure,  XC or AJR, as applicable,  shall immediately  furnish written notice thereof and the reason therefor to the other party. The performance of XC or AJR, as  applicable  shall be deemed  suspended  so long as and to the extent that any such Event  Force  Majeure  continues.
