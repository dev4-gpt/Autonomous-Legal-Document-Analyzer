                            ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ INDUSTRIES, INC.

                           Expiring December 31, 2007

            THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT,  for value  received,  Mayo  Foundation for
Medical  Education and Research (the  &#34;Holder&#34;) is entitled,  subject to certain
conditions  set forth in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 hereof,  to purchase  from Gateway
Industries,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  (the  &#34;Company&#34;),  at the  Company&#39;s
principal  executive  office,  at the Exercise  Price,  up to 50,000 shares (the
&#34;Warrant  Shares&#34;) of Common Stock,  $.001 par value per share (&#34;Common Stock&#34;),
all  subject to  adjustment  and upon the terms and  conditions  as  hereinafter
provided,  and is entitled also to exercise the other appurtenant rights, powers
and privileges hereinafter described.

            Certain terms used in this Warrant are defined in Article IV hereof.


                                   ARTICLE I

                               METHOD OF EXERCISE

            1.1 TIME OF EXERCISE;  SUBSIDIARY CHANGE OF CONTROL.  Subject to the
provisions of Sections 1.2 and 1.3 hereof, this Warrant shall become exercisable
subject to the achievement of certain revenue goals related to New Business. The
Warrant shall become exercisable as to fifty percent (50%) of the Warrant Shares
(and shall remain  exercisable  until the Expiration  Time) if cumulative  gross







revenues  from New  Business  for the  first  time  exceeds  $1,000,000  for any
calendar  year  commencing  January 1, 2003 and ending  December 31,  2006.  The
Warrant shall become exercisable as to one hundred percent (100%) of the Warrant
Shares (and shall remain  exercisable  until the Expiration  Time) if cumulative
gross  revenues  from New Business  exceeds  $2,000,000  for any  calendar  year
commencing  January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2006,  regardless of whether
any portion of the Warrant was exercisable prior thereto.

            Upon a Subsidiary Change of Control, this Warrant, to the extent not
previously  exercised,  shall become  exercisable in full for a period of ninety
(90) days from the occurrence of such Subsidiary  Change of Control.  At the end
of such ninety (90) day period, the Warrant will immediately terminate and shall
no longer be exercisable.

            1.2  CERTIFICATION  OF REVENUES FROM NEW  BUSINESS;  RIGHT TO AUDIT.
During the term of this Warrant,  within  forty-five (45) days following the end
of each  calendar  year  following  the date of  issuance of this  Warrant,  the
Company  shall  deliver to the  Holder a  certificate  from the Chief  Financial
Officer of the Company  setting forth  revenues  generated from New Business for
such completed year (each, a  &#34;Certification&#34;).  The Holder shall have the right
to retain an independent accounting firm selected by the Holder to audit, at the
Holder&#39;s  expense,  the Company&#39;s books and records to determine the accuracy of
any Certification,  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
by delivering a written  notice to the Company within thirty (30) days following
the Holder&#39;s receipt of the Certification in question.  If such audit results in
a discrepancy then the Holder and the Company shall for a thirty (30) day period
seek to  resolve  such  discrepancy.  If not  resolved,  the  dispute  shall  be
submitted to an independent  accounting firm mutually  acceptable to the Company
and the Holder whose determination shall be binding.  The Holder and the Company
shall split equally the fees of such independent accounting firm. Failure by the
Company to deliver any Certification within the prescribed time period shall not
be deemed a breach of this  Warrant  if cured  within  ten (10) days of  written
demand from the Holder.

            1.3 METHOD OF  EXERCISE.  To  exercise  this  Warrant in whole or in
part,  the Holder  shall  deliver to the  Company,  at the  Company&#39;s  principal
executive  office,  (a) this  Warrant,  (b) a written  notice  of such  Holder&#39;s
election to exercise this Warrant in the form attached hereto and (c) payment of
the Exercise Price with respect to such shares. Such payment may be made, at the
option of the Holder, in cash, by certified or bank cashier&#39;s check, money order
or wire transfer, in the manner specified in the next succeeding  paragraph,  or
in any other manner  consented to in writing by the Company,  or any combination
thereof.

            Notwithstanding  any provisions  herein in the contrary,  in lieu of
exercising  this  Warrant  as  hereinabove  permitted,  the  Holder may elect to
exercise  this  Warrant or a portion  hereof and to pay for the  Warrant  Shares
issuable  upon such  exercise  by way of  cashless  exercise  (a) by delivery of
shares of Common Stock or other  securities of the Company  already owned by the
Holder with an aggregate  Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the
aggregate Exercise Price,  subject,  however, to the provisions of Section 16(b)
of the  Exchange  Act  or (b) by  surrendering  this  Warrant  at the  principal
executive office of the Company,  together with the Notice of Exercise, in which
event the  Company  shall  issue to the Holder  that  number of  Warrant  Shares
computed using the following formula:

                                       2



                                  X= Y x (A-B)
                                     ---------
                                        A

Where:

                 X equals  the  number  of  Warrant  Shares  to be issued to the
                 Holder;

                 Y equals  the number of Warrant  Shares  purchasable  under the
                 Warrant  or,  if  only  a  portion  of  the  Warrant  is  being
                 exercised,  the portion of the Warrant being  exercised (at the
                 date of such calculation);

                 A  equals  the  Fair   Market   Value  (at  the  date  of  such
                 calculation) of one share of Common Stock; and

                 B equals the Exercise Price.

            The Company shall,  as promptly as practicable  after receipt of the
items  required by the  preceding  paragraphs  of this Section 1.3,  execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered, in accordance with such notice, a
certificate or certificates  representing the aggregate number of Warrant Shares
specified in such notice.  The share  certificate or  certificates  so delivered
shall be in such denominations as shall be specified in such notice and shall be
issued in the name of the Holder or such other  name as shall be  designated  in
such notice;  provided,  in an opinion of counsel  reasonably  acceptable to the
Company,  the  issuance  in such  other  name  is  permitted  under  the Act and
applicable  state  securities  laws. Such  certificate or certificates  shall be
deemed to have been  issued,  and such Holder or Holders or any other  person so
designated to be named therein shall be deemed for all purposes to have become a
Holder of record of such  shares,  as of the date the  aforementioned  notice is
received by the Company. If this Warrant shall have been exercised only in part,
the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the  certificate or  certificates,
deliver  to the  Holder a new  Warrant  evidencing  the  right to  purchase  the
remaining Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant,  which new Warrant shall in
all other  respects  be  identical  to this  Warrant,  or, at the request of the
Holder,  appropriate  notations  may be made on this Warrant which shall then be
returned to the  Holder.  The Company  shall pay all  expenses,  taxes and other
charges  payable in connection  with the  preparation,  issuance and delivery of
share  certificates and new Warrants,  except that, if share certificates or new
Warrants  shall  be  registered  in a name or names  other  than the name of the
Holder,  funds sufficient to pay all transfer taxes, if any, payable as a result
of such  transfer  shall be paid by the  Holder  at the time of  delivering  the
aforementioned  notice of exercise or promptly upon receipt of a written request
of the Company for payment.

            1.4   RESERVATION   OF   SHARES;   SHARES  TO  BE  FULLY   PAID  AND
NONASSESSABLE.  The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of
its  authorized but unissued  shares of Common Stock,  solely for the purpose of
effecting  the  exercise  of this  Warrant,  such number of its shares of Common

                                       3





Stock as shall  from  time to time be  sufficient  to effect  the full  exercise
hereof;  and if at any time the  number of  authorized  but  unissued  shares of
Common Stock shall not be  sufficient  to effect the full  exercise  hereof,  in
addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the Holder, the Company
will take such  corporate  action as may,  in the  opinion  of its  counsel,  be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient  for such purposes,  including,  without
limitation,  engaging  in best  efforts  to  obtain  the  requisite  stockholder
approval of any  necessary  amendment to these  provisions.  All Warrant  Shares
issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be duly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

            1.5 NO  FRACTIONAL  SHARES TO BE ISSUED.  The  Company  shall not be
required to issue fractions of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.  If
any  fractions  of a share would,  but for this  Section,  be issuable  upon any
exercise of this Warrant, in lieu of such fractional share the Company shall pay
to the Holder,  in cash, an amount equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock.

            1.6 SHARE LEGEND.  Each  certificate  for Warrant Shares issued upon
exercise  of this  Warrant,  unless  at the time of  exercise  such  shares  are
registered under the Act, shall bear a legend substantially as follows:

            THE SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT
            BEEN  REGISTERED  UNDER  THE  SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933,  AS
            AMENDED,  OR APPLICABLE  STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT
            BE  TRANSFERRED,  SOLD  OR  OTHERWISE  DISPOSED  OF IN THE
            ABSENCE  OF  AN  EFFECTIVE   REGISTRATION  STATEMENT  WITH
            RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES  EVIDENCED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE,
            FILED AND MADE EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
            AS AMENDED,  AND SUCH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR
            UNLESS  THE   COMPANY   RECEIVES  AN  OPINION  OF  COUNSEL
            SATISFACTORY   TO  THE   COMPANY   TO  THE   EFFECT   THAT
            REGISTRATION  UNDER  SUCH  ACT AND SUCH  APPLICABLE  STATE
            SECURITIES LAWS IS NOT REQUIRED.

            Any certificate  issued at any time in exchange or substitution  for
any  certificate  bearing  such  legend  (except a new  certificate  issued upon
completion of a public distribution  pursuant to a registration  statement under
the Act)  shall  also  bear  such  legend  unless,  in the  opinion  of  counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Company, the securities represented thereby need no
longer be subject to restrictions on resale under the Act.

                                       4





                                   ARTICLE II

                      REPLACEMENTS OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES

            2.1 LOSS, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES. Upon receipt
of evidence  satisfactory  to the  Company of the loss,  theft,  destruction  or
mutilation  of any  Warrant  and,  in  the  case  of any  such  loss,  theft  or
destruction,  upon receipt of indemnity or security from the Holder satisfactory
to the  Company,  or, in the case of any such  mutilation,  upon  surrender  and
cancellation of the Warrant,  the Company will make and deliver, in lieu of such
lost,  stolen,  destroyed or mutilated  Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and
representing the right to purchase the same aggregate number of Warrant Shares.

            2.2 CHANGE OF PRINCIPAL  EXECUTIVE  OFFICE. In the event the Company
shall change the address of its principal  executive  office,  the Company shall
give  the  Holder  notice  of any such  change  within a  reasonable  time.  Any
correspondence  from the  Company to the Holder  with an address  printed on the
Company&#39;s letterhead shall fulfill this requirement.


                                  ARTICLE III

                             ANTIDILUTION PROVISIONS

            3.1  ADJUSTMENTS  GENERALLY.  The  Exercise  Price and the number of
shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property)  issuable upon exercise
of this  Warrant  shall be  subject  to  adjustment  from  time to time upon the
occurrence of certain events, as provided in this Article III.

            3.2  CERTAIN  ADJUSTMENTS.  The  Exercise  Price shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:

                 (a) STOCK SPLITS, SUBDIVISIONS.

            (1) In the event the Company should at any time or from time to time
after the date first written above fix a record date for the  effectuation  of a
split  or  subdivision  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other
distribution  payable  in  additional  shares  of Common  Stock or Common  Stock
equivalents  without  payment  of any  consideration  by  such  holder  for  the
additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock equivalents (including the
additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof),
then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend  distribution,  split
or  subdivision  if no  record  date is  fixed),  the  Exercise  Price  shall be
appropriately  decreased and the number of shares of Common Stock  issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant  shall be increased in  proportion  to such increase in
the aggregate of shares of Common Stock outstanding and issuable with respect to
such Common Stock equivalents.

            (2) If the number of shares of Common Stock  outstanding at any time
after  the  date  first  written  above is  decreased  by a  combination  of the
outstanding  shares of Common  Stock,  then,  following  the record date of such
combination,  the Exercise Price shall be appropriately increased and the number
of shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  on  exercise  of this  Warrant  shall be
decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

                                       5





                 (b)  RECAPITALIZATIONS.  If at any  time or  from  time to time
there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,
combination  or merger or sale of assets  transaction  provided for elsewhere in
this Section 3.2),  provision shall be made so that the Holder shall  thereafter
be entitled  to receive  upon  exercise of this  Warrant the number of shares of
stock or other  securities or property of the Company or  otherwise,  to which a
holder of Common Stock  deliverable  upon  exercise  would have been entitled on
such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in
the application of the provisions of this Section 3.2 with respect to the rights
of the Holder after the  recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this
Section 3.2  (including  adjustment of the Exercise Price then in effect and the
number of shares  issuable upon  exercise of this  Warrant)  shall be applicable
after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

                 (c) NO  AVOIDANCE.  The Company  will not, by  amendment of its
Certificate of  Incorporation or through any  reorganization,  recapitalization,
transfer  of  assets,  consolidation,  merger,  dissolution,  issue  or  sale of
securities or any other voluntary action,  avoid or seek to avoid the observance
or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed  hereunder by the
Company,  but will at all times in good faith  assist in the carrying out of all
the  provisions  of this Section 3.2 and in the taking of all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder.

                 (d)  REORGANIZATIONS,   RECLASSIFICATIONS,   PARENT  CHANGE  OF
CONTROL. If any capital  reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock
of the  Company,  or a Parent  Change of Control,  shall be effected  while this
Warrant is  outstanding  in such a manner that holders of shares of Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive  stock,  securities or assets with respect to or in
exchange  for Common  Stock,  then,  as a condition  of such  reorganization  or
reclassification,  or Parent  Change of Control,  lawful and adequate  provision
shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive upon
the basis and upon the terms and conditions  specified herein and in lieu of the
shares of Common Stock immediately  theretofore receivable upon exercise of this
Warrant, such shares of stock,  securities or assets as may be issued or payable
with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock immediately theretofore
so receivable had such reorganization or  reclassification,  or Parent Change of
Control not taken place,  and in such case  appropriate  provision shall be made
with  respect  to the  rights  and  interests  of the Holder to the end that the
provisions hereof (including,  without limitation,  provisions for adjustment of
the  Exercise  Price and of the number of shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon
exercise thereof) shall thereafter be applicable,  as nearly as may be possible,
in relation to any shares of stock,  securities or assets thereafter deliverable
upon  the  exercise  of  this  Warrant.  Prior  to or  simultaneously  with  the
consummation  of any such Parent  Change of Control,  the  survivor or successor
corporation  (if other than the Company)  resulting  from such Parent  Change of

                                       6





Control  or the  corporation  purchasing  such  assets  shall  assume by written
instrument  executed and mailed or delivered to the Holder,  the  obligation  to
deliver  to such  Holder  such  shares of  stock,  securities  or assets  as, in
accordance  with the  foregoing  provisions,  such  Holder  may be  entitled  to
receive, and containing the express assumption of such successor  corporation of
the due and  punctual  performance  and  observance  of every  provision of this
Warrant (as such may be amended from time to time) to be performed  and observed
by the Company and of all liabilities  and obligations of the Company  hereunder
with respect to this Warrant.

                 (e)  NOTICE OF RECORD  DATE.  In the event of any taking by the
Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of
determining  the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other
than a cash  dividend)  or  other  distribution,  any  right to  subscribe  for,
purchase  or  otherwise  acquire  any  shares of stock of any class or any other
securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Company shall mail to
the  Holder,  at least 10 days  prior to the date  specified  therein,  a notice
specifying  the date on which any such  record is to be taken for the purpose of
such  dividend,  distribution  or right,  and the amount and  character  of such
dividend, distribution or right.

                 (f)  ADJUSTMENT  CERTIFICATE.   Upon  the  occurrence  of  each
adjustment or readjustment of the Exercise Price or the number of Warrant Shares
pursuant to this  Section  3.2, the  Company,  at its  expense,  shall  promptly
compute such  adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and  furnish to the Holder a  statement,  signed by its Chief  Financial
Officer  or  other  appropriate  officer,   setting  forth  such  adjustment  or
readjustment  and  showing in detail the facts  upon  which such  adjustment  or
readjustment is based.  The Company shall,  upon the written request at any time
of  the  Holder,  furnish  or  cause  to be  furnished  to  such  holder  a like
certificate  setting  forth  (i)  such  adjustment  and  readjustment,  (ii) the
Exercise  Price at the time in effect,  and (iii) the number of shares of Common
Stock and the  amount,  if any,  of other  property  which at the time  would be
received upon the exercise of this Warrant.
