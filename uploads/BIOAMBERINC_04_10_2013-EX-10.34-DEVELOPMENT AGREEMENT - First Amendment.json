Together these scale-up projects will be referred to as the \"Scale-up and Production Project\";\n\nWHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund the BRI Project and to conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to the  following terms and conditions. Now therefore the Parties agree:\n\nAmendment To the Development Agreement\n\nA. Section 13.9 of the Development Agreement is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:   \"Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates  the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof).  Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.   B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"\n\nAmendment To the Commercial License\n\nA. Section 5.9 of the Commercial License is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:\n\n\"Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.\"\n\nNothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.      * Confidential treatment requested\n\nth th\n\n\n\n\n\n   * Confidential treatment requested\n\nCARGILL, INCORPORATED\n\nBy:    /s/ Pirkko Suominen\n\n\n\nName: Pirkko Suominen Title: Director, Bio Technology Development  Center, Minneapolis Date:   10/19/2011\n\nBIOAMBER, SAS\n\nBy:    /s/ Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Huc\n\n\n\nName: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Huc Title: President Date:   October 15, 2011"
