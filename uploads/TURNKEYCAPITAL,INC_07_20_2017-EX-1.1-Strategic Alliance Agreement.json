Commercial Blvd, Suite PH-D, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, hereinafter referred to as \"TKCI\";\n\nAnd:\n\nA Seminole Indian Company to be formed by Former Seminole Tribal Chairman James E. Billie and Craig Talesman, having an office located at 1800 Frank Huff Road, Seminole Reservation, Okeechobee, FL 34974, hereinafter referred to as \"SIC\".\n\nOverview\n\nThe purpose and intent of this strategic alliance is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. New marketing advantages based upon competitive pricing, cross marketing and new revenue streams from expansion into other industries will grow the business beyond anything previously imagined. The structure may also be used for additional compatible acquisitions which will also fuel growth. TKCI believes that structuring operations with Tribal Sovereignty will deliver the financial advantages of operating in a tax free environment with limited liability, plus other benefits such as permit and zoning ease, supporting an ideal structure for investment capital and successful entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nTerm\n\nThe term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months.
