Method 1.  (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business  name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with  specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a  specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (\"Seeded Profile\"). As of  the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over  6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an  \"Activated User.\"     (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the  Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded  Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a  user, that user will be deemed to be an \"Activated User\" and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.     Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an  Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"     II  Royalty and Initial Bonus     1. Royalty. The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of  common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The  form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the \"Royalty Warrant.\"\n\n\n\n9\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n   2. Initial Bonus. Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to  purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant is  attached hereto as Schedule A-II and shall be referred to as the \"Bonus Warrant.\"     3. Restrictive Legend. The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant, and the stock  certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\") or  any state securities law. These shares have been acquired for investment and may not be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred, nor  will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective  registration statement with respect to the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to  the Company that such shares will be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under or is  otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws.     ***\n\n10\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012"
