If the  Principal  is a natural  person,  upon the  death  or  mental  incapacity  of a  Principal,  the executor,  administrator,  or personal  representative  of such Principal  shall transfer the Principal's interest in Franchisee to a third party approved by BKC within a  reasonable  time  after the  Principal's  death or mental  incapacity.

The failure of BKC to exercise any right or option given to it hereunder,  or to insist upon strict  compliance by the  Franchisee or the Principals or any person  comprising the  Franchisee or the Principals  with the terms  of this  Agreement,  shall  not  constitute  a  waiver  of any  terms  or conditions of this Agreement with respect to any other or subsequent breach, nor a waiver by BKC of its right at any time  thereafter to require exact and strict compliance  with all the terms of this  Agreement.  The rights or  remedies  set forth in this  Agreement  are in addition to any other rights or remedies  which may be granted by law.\n\n                                      32\n\n      19.3  GOVERNING  LAW/JURISDICTION.
