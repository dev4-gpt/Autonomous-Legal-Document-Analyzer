DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR          WARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED          WARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF          DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY          OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE          DISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI. In the event that the Product fails to          conform to the warranties herein given, DISTRIBUTOR's exclusive remedy          and PPG SHANGHAI's sole responsibility is, at PPG SHANGHAI's option,          limited to the replacement of such nonconforming Product at PPG          SHANGHAI's expense or the refund of the purchase price attributable to          a specific delivery as to which a claim is made. For the avoidance of          doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is          not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been          taken away from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or          its transport agent.\n\n11.2     It is PPG SHANGHAI's responsibility to ensure that mis-delivery of          Product is kept to the minimum. DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products          within 48 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products\n\n\n\n\n\n         delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing,          detailing all the discrepancies within 48 hours after delivery. PPG          SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond          the 48 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery,          DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall          report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 48 hours. The necessary and          sufficient evidence (and photos) required for insurance claim must be          submitted altogether. None of the damaged Products shall be disposed of          until the claim is settled by the insurance company or PPG SHANGHAI.\n\n11.3     DISTRIBUTOR assumes all responsibility, risk and liability arising from          (i) the unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products, including use thereof alone or in combination with other          substances; (ii) the improper functioning or failure of unloading,          discharge, transportation or storage systems equipment used by          DISTRIBUTOR, whether furnished or recommended by PPG SHANGHAI or not;          and (iii) the failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations          governing unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products.\n\n12.      FORCE MAJEURE\n\nPPG SHANGHAI's failure or inability to make, or DISTRIBUTOR's failure or inability to take, any delivery or deliveries when due, or the failure or inability of either party to effect timely performance of any other obligation required of it hereunder, if caused by \"force majeure\" as hereinafter defined, shall not constitute a default hereunder or subject the party affected by force majeure to any liability to the other; provided, however, that the party so affected shall promptly notify the other of the existence thereof and of its expected duration and the estimated effect thereof upon its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Such party shall promptly notify the other party when such force majeure circumstance has ceased to affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. The quantity to be delivered hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of the deliveries omitted for such cause or causes, unless both parties agree that the total quantity to be delivered hereunder shall remain unchanged. For so long as its ability to perform hereunder is affected by such force majeure circumstance, PPG SHANGHAI may, at its option, elect to allocate its total production of Product among its various requirements therefor (e.g., manufacturing and sales) in such manner as PPG SHANGHAI deems practicable and which, in the opinion of PPG SHANGHAI, is fair and reasonable. During the time that PPG SHANGHAI is unable to make deliveries or otherwise perform, it shall not be obligated to procure, or to use its best efforts to procure, any quantity of Product sold hereunder from any alternate producer or supplier. As used herein, the term \"force majeure\" shall mean and include any act of God, nature or the public enemy, accident, explosion, operation malfunction or interruption, fire, storm, earthquake, flood, drought, perils of the sea, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, riots, sabotage, embargo, war (whether or not declared and whether or not the United States of America is a participant), federal, state or municipal legal restriction or limitation or compliance therewith, inability to obtain export licenses, failure or delay of transportation, shortage of, or inability to obtain, raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel, power, labor, or other operational necessity, interruption, or curtailment of power supply, or any other circumstance of a similar or different nature beyond the reasonable control of the party affected thereby. In this connection, a party shall not be required to resolve labor disputes or disputes with suppliers of raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel or power, except in accordance with such party's business judgment as to its best interest.\n\n13.      PRODUCT HANDLING\n\nDISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has experience and expertise in handling and storing the Products, and that DISTRIBUTOR has the obligation to handle, store and distribute the Products safely and properly.\n\n14.      PRODUCT SAFETY\n\nPPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR recognize the importance of product safety considerations and the need to protect persons and property against unsafe conditions that could occur from the improper use, transportation, storage, handling, distribution or disposal of the Products sold hereunder. PPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR will follow PPG's Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines as set forth in the attached Appendix I (Responsible Care(R) is a registered trademark in the United States of the American Chemistry Council ). Accordingly, PPG SHANGHAI will furnish certain information to DISTRIBUTOR regarding product safety and handling aspects of the Products, and DISTRIBUTOR, in addition to its independent responsibility to obtain and implement a product safety program regarding the Products, will implement and conform to PPG SHANGHAI's product safety recommendations and Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines, DISTRIBUTOR will also provide its customers, employees and other third parties foreseeably exposed to the Products with appropriate warnings, advice and other material regarding the Products, including all product safety and handling material provided by PPG SHANGHAI, and will ensure that the Products are used, stored, handled, distributed, transported and disposed of in a manner consistent with all of the above recommendations.\n\n15.      PRODUCT DISCONTINUANCE\n\nDISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has express notice that PPG or PPG SHANGHAI may at any time discontinue the production and/or sale of any of the Products. If PPG or PPG SHANGHAI does discontinue the production and/or sale of any of the Products, this Agreement shall automatically terminate with respect to such discontinued Product, and DISTRIBUTOR shall not be entitled to claim or receive\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom PPG or PPG SHANGHAI any compensation, reimbursement or damages of any nature as a result (direct or indirect) of PPG or PPG SHANGHAI's discontinuance of the production and/or sale of the affected Product.\n\n16.      LIMITATION OF DAMAGES\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, on the termination of this Agreement for any cause whatsoever, DISTRIBUTOR shall not be entitled to claim or receive from PPG SHANGHAI any compensation, reimbursement, or damages on account of any expenditure or commitment of any kind in connection with its business or on account of goodwill or on account of loss of prospective profits or otherwise. In no event shall PPG SHANGHAI be liable for consequential damages.\n\n17.      BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\n17.1     In the performance of its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement,          DISTRIBUTOR agrees to make every effort to operate as a good,          responsible and ethical corporate entity in the Territory and will          comply with the laws of the Territory, the applicable laws of the          United States of America and the countries of origin of the Products.          DISTRIBUTOR further agrees that it will not, in connection with this          Agreement or its performance hereunder, directly or indirectly offer,          pay, promise to pay or authorize the payment of any money or thing of          value to any employee of a customer or to any government official or to          any person,\n\n         (a)      to improperly or unlawfully influence any act or decision of                   such customer employee or governmental official, including a                   decision to fail to perform his/her official functions, or\n\n         (b)      to induce such customer employee or government official to use                   his/her influence with the customer or the government (or                   instrumentality thereof), respectively, to affect or influence                   any act or decision of such customer or government (or                   instrumentality), in order to assist PPG SHANGHAI or                   DISTRIBUTOR in obtaining or retaining business or directing                   business to any other party. As used in this Section, the term                   \"government official\" means any officer or employee of any                   government or any department, agency, instrumentality or                   wholly-owned corporation thereof, or any person acting in an                   official capacity for or on behalf of any such government or                   department, agency, instrumentality or wholly-owned                   corporation thereof, or any candidate for political office.\n\n17.2     DISTRIBUTOR agrees to notify PPG SHANGHAI immediately of any          solicitation, demand or other request for anything of value, by or on          behalf of any employee of a customer, government official or employee          of any government which is directed to itself or to PPG SHANGHAI          related to the sale and/or service of the Products.\n\n17.3     DISTRIBUTOR agrees to require any sub-distributor or other person which          it hires or engages to assist in the performance of this Agreement to          comply with the provisions of this Section 17.\n\n18.      TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\n18.1     The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") shall commence on the date          first above written and shall terminate on 31 December 2006, unless          sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.\n\n18.2     The parties hereof intend to form a long-term relationship. To this          end, if both parties wish to renew this Agreement, the parties shall          agree on such intention in writing at least thirty(30) days before the          expiry of the current Term of the Agreement. The parties shall agree on          the terms and conditions of the renewal, and enter into a new agreement          within sixty(60) days from the expiry of this Agreement.
