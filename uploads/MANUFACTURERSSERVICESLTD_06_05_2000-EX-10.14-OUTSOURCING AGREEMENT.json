IBM shall             advise MSL [*] Days in advance of the scope and method by which             such audits are to be conducted. MSL will be given the opportunity             to comment upon these procedures prior to the audit taking place.             For all identified IBM specifications, MSL will maintain and             produce for IBM process documentation for use in all audits             performed by IBM and will have current copies of said documentation             available prior to the start of an audit.\n\n      b)    Upon completion of all audits performed, IBM will provide written             documentation to MSL of the audit results in the form of an audit             report. MSL will be required to respond in writing to IBM on the             completion status of all actions and or requirements identified in             the audit report within [*] Days of receipt of the audit report.\n\nSECTION 8.0 PURCHASE OF ASSETS\n\n      a)    On the Effective Date, MSL shall purchase all tangible assets listed             in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1A and non-capitalized hand tools             used in the manufacture of Products for [*] U.S. dollars [*].             Within [*] days of the Effective Date, IBM shall give the tangible             assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to MSL. On the             Effective Date, MSL shall purchase\n\nPage 10                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n            the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 for the amount             stated on the bill of sale for such assets and pay for such assets             in full by or before December 1, 1998 (the \"Payment Date\").\n\n      b)    The Parties acknowledge that the assets listed in Attachment 3:             Asset List, are a pro forma listing only and that within 10 (ten)             days of the Effective Date, both parties agree to perform a physical             audit of these assets listed and in IBM's possession as of the             Effective date to ascertain that the assets located during that             physical audit are verified. Within 20 (twenty) days after the             Effective Date, IBM will prepare a listing of the assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to verify IBM's net book value of             the assets plus [*] for each non-capitalized printer. This listing             shall contain the price for each asset listed separately. MSL shall             notify IBM within 30 (thirty) days of the Effective Date if it does             not wish to receive all of the available tangible assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B by notifying IBM in writing of the             types of equipment it does not wish to receive. IBM shall choose             which equipment MSL will receive based on MSL's chosen equipment             type. The startup and investment expense defined in Attachment 4,             Section 3, shall be reduced by IBM's net book value of the assets in             Part 1B for the equipment accepted by MSL plus [*] U.S. dollars             [*] for each non-capitalized printer. In any event, the physical             audit for all assets shall result in a new listing for the assets             contemplated hereunder which listing shall be substituted for the             Attachment 3: Asset List that is attached to this Agreement at the             Effective Date. The amount stated on the bill of sale of the assets             listed in Part 2 shall reflect the results of a physical audit and             obsolescence review. Such adjustments shall be subject to the             mutual agreement of the Parties.\n\n      c)    If by the Payment Date, MSL fails to pay IBM in full for the assets             listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 at the price specified in             b) above, IBM may offset the balance owed by MSL as provided in             Section 6.2(a) above, and without MSL's further consent, until IBM             has recovered such balance.\n\n      d)    MSL acknowledges that IBM has not made any representations or             warranties with respect to the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset             List, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, including,             but not limited to the representation and warranty of title. All             assets delivered to MSL pursuant to this section shall be provided             on an 'AS IS' basis. NO OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR             IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THE WARRANTY OF             NON-INFRINGMENT ARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\n      e)    In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement             pursuant to Section 5.0 above, IBM shall have an option, which             shall expire [*] days after such termination or expiration, to             purchase from MSL, at a reasonable price agreeable to the Parties,             all assets used by MSL to perform the manufacturing and fulfillment             functions\n\nPage 11\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n            outlined in Attachment 1: Statement of Work, to the extent owned or             transferable by MSL, and required by IBM to perform such functions.\n\n      f)    Assets purchased by MSL and listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part             2 are to be used solely in Products purchased by IBM pursuant to the             Attachment 1: Statement of Work.\n\nSECTION 9.0 PERSONNEL\n\n      a)    Attachment 2 contains a list of the individuals employed by IBM at             the date hereof in connection with this Agreement, including active             employees and employees who are on leave of absence or sick leave             (herein the \"Employees\").\n\n      b)    MSL will make an unconditional employment offer to the Employees,             listed in Attachment 2, to be effective on the Effective Date of             this Agreement. The Employees who accept employment offers from             MSL and who have begun their employment with MSL (\"Transferred             Employees\") will be employed by MSL in accordance with the terms set             forth below. IBM will terminate all Employees, listed in Attachment             2, at the Effective Date of this Agreement and IBM will be             responsible for any and all employment related liabilities up to the             Effective Date, including, but not limited to, vacation and sick             time, workers compensation claims, variable compensation, and             severance.\n\n      c)    MSL agrees that all Transferred Employees will be continuously             employed by MSL for at least [*] after the Effective Date, except as             otherwise provided herein, and will receive a total compensation             package as identified in Attachment 2: Employee list and Benefits             Information. Furthermore, with respect to the Transferred Employees,             MSL shall grant, to the extent granted by IBM, credit for service             with IBM prior to the Effective Date for purposes of participation             and eligibility to participate under MSL's employee benefit plans             and other policies and programs of MSL.\n\n      d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall operate in any way to limit or             prevent MSL from terminating any Transferred Employee at any time             for reasons of cause related to poor job performance or conditions             of employment.\n\n      e)    If MSL suffers a substantially adverse change in its business,             related to a reduction in IBM's Products requirements, including             reductions of Products requirements due to migration to a             competitive supplier, for the [*] from the Effective Date of this             Agreement, MSL may terminate such number of Transferred Employees             as it deems necessary. However, IBM shall only reimburse MSL for             termination benefits paid to such Transferred Employees, which are             substantially similar to IBM's then severance package, and             provided that all MSL subcontractors and other MSL non management             employees assigned to the US Work Center have been terminated             prior to or along with the termination of the Transferred             Employees.\n\nPage 12                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n      f)    IBM agrees that, for a period of [*] years from the Effective Date             of this Agreement, it will not in any way solicit for employment             any Transferred Employees without the prior written consent of MSL;             provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict or prevent             IBM from a) employing any such person who contacts IBM on his or her             own initiative without any solicitation or encouragement from IBM             or b) by using general employment advertising or communications or             independent search firms, hiring any person who responds thereto,             provided that IBM does not direct or encourage such independent             search firms to solicit such Transferred Employees.\n\nSECTION 10.0 LEASE OF PREMISES\n\n      The Lease of Premises Agreement is a separate agreement governing the       lease of certain IBM buildings to MSL, the execution of which is a       condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 11.0 MANUFACTURING, FULFILLMENT, AND INTEGRATION\n\n      Attachment 1 is the Statement of Work that outlines the manufacturing,       fulfillment, and Integration requirements and responsibilities of both       parties.\n\nSECTION 12.0 TRANSITION SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n\n      Supplement 1 to the Statement of Work identifies the Transition Services       that the Parties are to perform in accordance with the prices set forth       therein and starting on the Effective Date of the Agreement. All       Transition Services will expire December 31, 1998.\n\nSECTION 13.0 INTELLECTUAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY\n\n13.1  IBM assumes and will assume ownership and MSL assigns and will assign all       intellectual and industrial property rights for hardware, software, design       and documentation of all Products delivered under this Agreement\n\n      IBM will also own and MSL will assign any invention made by MSL on       Products, and on any invention related to IBM processes and systems that       MSL makes while MSL uses those processes and systems in the performance of       this Agreement provided that nothing herein shall restrict MSL's right to       use such inventions in the performance of its obligations hereunder. MSL       shall not use any proprietary processes for the assembly, subassembly and       final tests, and quality testing of the Products subject to this Agreement       unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.\n\n13.2  Confidential Information and Advertising\n\nPage 13                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n      a)    IBM shall not receive confidential information from MSL under this             Agreement. However, if it becomes necessary for IBM to give certain             confidential information to MSL, it will be done so pursuant to the             Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information (\"AECI\") Number             4998S60076.\n\n      b)    All information considered confidential by IBM will be marked             confidential by IBM prior to the exchange. If the confidential             information is to be disclosed orally, IBM will promptly provide MSL             with a written summary following the disclosure. In the event, the             information is not marked confidential, it shall not be deemed             confidential.\n\n      c)    Each time IBM wishes to disclose specific information to MSL, IBM             will issue a supplement to the above referenced AECI. All requests             to disclose confidential information must be approved by the             Relationship Managers. During the term of this Agreement and upon             the request of IBM, MSL shall return all confidential information             immediately.\n\n      d)    Neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement to any             third Party, including debt or financing institutions, without the             prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be             unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as required by law. Each             Party shall provide the other with prior written notice of any such             required disclosure.\n\n      e)    Neither Party shall make any public announcements regarding this             Agreement or matters pertaining hereto, other than as may be             expressly agreed upon in advance by the Parties in writing.\n\n13.3  Licenses\n\n      a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing             in this Agreement grants or may grant MSL any rights or licenses in             any preexisting intellectual property of IBM except that IBM grants             MSL a royalty-free license to use the confidential information             disclosed in connection with this Agreement under the AECI             referenced in 13.2 necessary to manufacture Products solely for IBM.             Any other license to IBM's intellectual property must be             accomplished through a separate written agreement signed by IBM.\n\n      b)    As of the Effective Date, to the best of IBM's knowledge, IBM has             licenses and permits and other governmental authorizations and             approvals required for IBM's use of the assets in Attachment 3:             Asset List, except where the failure to have such licenses and             permits would not have a material adverse effect on IBM's ability to             use or operate the assets. All such licenses and permits held by IBM             which are material to the operation of the assets are valid and in             full force and effect and there are not pending or, to the knowledge             of IBM, threatened in a writing to IBM, any proceedings which could             result in the termination or impairment of any such license or             permit which termination or impairment would materially interfere             with the operation or use of the assets as\n\nPage 14                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n            presently operated or used by IBM.

The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be subject to       the condition that IBM deliver to MSL a certificate on and as of the       Effective Date that such representations and warranties are correct and       complete as of such date.\n\n      \"To the best of IBM's knowledge\" shall be defined as the information       available to IBM Charlotte Management after due inquiry as of the       Effective Date. A materially adverse effect shall be defined as an outcome       where MSL is unable to acquire appropriate title for assets to be       purchased under this Agreement.\n\n      a)    Organization of IBM\n\n            IBM is a New York corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and             in good standing under the laws of New York.

All corporate and other actions or proceedings to be             taken by or on the part of IBM to authorize and permit the execution             and delivery by IBM of this Agreement and the instruments required             to be executed and delivered by IBM pursuant hereto, the performance             by IBM of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation by IBM of             the transactions contemplated herein, have been duly and properly             taken.

A proposed change             shall be initiated by the proposing Party in a written notice to the             other Party.\n\n      c)    MSL and IBM shall appoint program managers to handle communications             specific to each Product Group related to this Agreement. Names of             the program managers will be listed in each Product Attachment.\n\n      d)    Either Party may change its program manager by written notice.\n\n      e)    Both Parties recognize that efficiency of operation may frequently             require direct communication between program managers, or other             individuals working for the Parties, without the intermediation of             the Relationship Managers. Notwithstanding the above, MSL accepts             that only commitments issued by the IBM Relationship Managers or             their delegates are valid IBM commitments with respect to this             Agreement. Also, IBM accepts that only commitments issued by the MSL             Relationship Managers or their delegates are valid MSL commitments             with respect to this Agreement.\n\n      f)    The Relationship Managers or their delegates will also coordinate             review meetings and will provide each other assessments of the             performance and the business situation of the relationship             throughout the duration of this Agreement.\n\n      g)    Each Party may at any time redesignate a person as Relationship             Manager by written notice to the other.\n\n      Relationship Managers:\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 10 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      for US Work Center\n\n      IBM:\n\n      MSL:\n\n      IBM will separately designate a Relationship Manager for EMEA.\n\nSECTION 6.0 PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MSL agrees to       produce and sell, and IBM agrees to purchase Products. This Agreement does       not authorize MSL to produce or deliver any Product.\n\n6.1   Cancellation of Purchase Order\n\n      IBM may cancel any and all Purchase Orders against this Agreement at any       time. In the event IBM cancels Purchase Order as the result of MSL's       default, no cancellation charge shall be applicable. IBM's termination of       Purchase Orders for its convenience shall not relieve IBM of any cost       reimbursements under the Price section.\n\nSECTION 7.0 PRICE\n\n      Pricing for all Products and related services of this Agreement are as\n\n\n\n\n\n      specified herein unless stated elsewhere in this Agreement.

This penalty shall not apply             if requirements accuracy for that machine type, as defined in             Appendix 2, exceeds [*]% and demand, for that machine type, exceeds             Supply Flexibility as defined in Section 13.2 and Appendix 4. The             first month for which this penalty shall be effective is June 1998.\n\n      c)    Any price adjustments that are due per Sections 7.3 a) or 7.3 b)             will be invoiced by IBM to MSL in the following calendar month.\n\n7.4   [*]\n\n      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, MSL represents       and warrants that\n\n      a)    If MSL [*] to another [*] under similar terms and conditions             including without limitation, [*], to those [*] to IBM and in [*]\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 13 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            or [*] during the same period, those [*] shall be made known and             available to IBM at the time of their availability to that [*].\n\n      b)    In the event IBM reasonably questions whether it is receiving [*]             treatment as described in Section 7.4 a), and MSL cannot otherwise             provide IBM with proof of its compliance due to third party             restrictions, both parties agree to have an independent party             evaluate IBM's inquiry to determine whether IBM has received proper             treatment under this Section. IBM and MSL agree that the information             disclosed by MSL to the independent party pursuant to this Section             7.4 b), will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement described             in the Agreement.\n\n      c)    For purposes of this Section a [*] shall mean a [*] from a qualified             third party [*] that contains an ongoing sustainable [*], which is             more [*] than MSL's [*] and which is subject to comparable terms and             conditions and for substantially similar [*], to build Product(s)             as opposed to provide [*] services for the Products(s).\n\n            i)    If IBM gets a [*] from an [*] resulting in a [*] which                   demonstrates MSL [*], IBM will notify MSL.

If MSL is unable to [*] the [*] subject to the conditions set                   forth in ii) below, then IBM may [*] the Product to the [*],                   and IBM and MSL shall mutually agree on a [*] plan for such                   Product(s). In this case MSL shall have all remedies for [*]                   in accordance with [*] of the Agreement.\n\n            ii)   If MSL is unable or unwilling to [*] the [*] because IBM's [*]                   for the Product has been below the minimum [*] parameter for                   the prior [*] months, MSL shall have a grace period [*] months                   from written notice of the [*] to make adjustments it deems                   necessary to [*] the [*]. This grace period is contingent upon                   MSL making, within [*] Days of notice of the [*], a commitment                   to [*] the [*] at the end of the grace period.\n\n      d)    In the event, IBM Latin America or IBM Asian Pacific were to receive             an [*] from a [*] that contains an ongoing [*], which is more [*]             than MSL's [*] and which is subject to comparable terms and             conditions and for substantially similar [*], to provide [*]             services for the Product(s), IBM will notify MSL.

However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result             of a previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*]% of the Parts price reduction will             be [*] to IBM.\n\nSECTION 9.0 PREMIUM COST\n\n      Premium costs may be incurred in order to meet Delivery Dates.\n\n      a)    MSL may submit premium costs to IBM for reimbursement that are in             addition to prices defined in Sections 7.1, and 7.2. Premium costs             include materials, labor and other extraordinary items.\n\n      b)    The Parties agree that [*] of all Parts price reductions will be [*]             to IBM when MSL begins using and shipping the lower costs Parts.             However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result of a             previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*] of the Parts price reduction will be             [*] to IBM.\n\n      b)    If Requirements Accuracy, as defined in Appendix 2, exceeds [*]%             and if demand is beyond Supply Flexibility as defined in Section             13.2 and Appendix 4, premium costs resulting solely from unplanned\n\n\n\n\n\n            demand shall be subject to reimbursement.\n\n      c)    Total premium costs for any single event which are equal to or             exceed [*] must be pre-approved in writing by IBM prior to MSL             authorizing or expending the premium. Total premium costs for any             single event which are less than [*] may be incurred by MSL without             IBM authorization to later be negotiated with IBM in good faith.\n\n      d)    MSL will use the following process for requesting authorization             and/or reimbursement of premium costs from IBM:\n\n      e)    Premium Price\n\n            i)    Material\n\n                  MSL agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase                   materials at the lowest possible cost within the lead times                   required or authorized by IBM. However, when materials are not                   available with IBM's lead times, premium cost for materials                   may apply. Premium cost for Parts is the [*] (which will not                   exceed MSL's actual cost paid to it's suppliers to be paid                   by IBM when the\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 17 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  Parts are required earlier than on the stated and mutually                   agreed upon lead time.

MSL staff shall in no way be                   deemed to be employees of IBM.\n\n                  [*] rate is the rate at which [*] are charged to IBM (as                   required by IBM), and will be in accordance with the [*]                   basis. The [*] rate shall not exceed [*]([*]%) of [*] rate.                   The actual [*] will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by                   IBM and MSL and will not exceed MSL's actual [*] paid to its                   [*] and [*]. MSL's request for authorization and/or                   reimbursement must state:\n\n                  (a)    Purchase price variance due to [*] or [*].\n\n                  (b)    Quantity of [*] by Product(s) part number.\n\n                  (c)    Quantity of units to be shipped due to [*].\n\n                  (d)    [*] Rate: US dollars/hour.\n\n                  (e)    Justification for [*].\n\n                  MSL agrees that it will invoice quoted Direct Labor Hours for                   actual Products Delivered.\n\n            iii)  Extraordinary Items\n\n                  MSL may propose premium rates for expedited tooling orders,                   premium transportation, and other extraordinary requirements.                   If IBM agrees that the resources are required, MSL and IBM                   will negotiate in good faith the price for such resources.\n\n                  MSL will report all open premium costs, which are subject to                   request for reimbursement by IBM as a part of monthly                   Measurements.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 18 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\nSECTION 10.0 ORDER MANAGEMENT, DELIVERY, AND SHIPMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1  Order Management\n\n      a)    IBM Customer Orders will be placed from IBM to MSL. MSL will fulfill             these orders according to the Performance Appendix 3 unless IBM             gives MSL specific written instruction otherwise. MSL will ship and             deliver these Products in accordance with the ship and delivery             dates stated on the order. In the case of Integration, shipments and             deliveries will be made in accordance to the customer roll out             schedules provided by IBM. MSL will conform to the stated lead times             agreed to and published by IBM to the Delivery Point as long as the             requested Delivery Date on the IBM Customer Order falls within MSL's             commitment to the forecast. Product lead times are published in the             Product Attachments.\n\n      b)    MSL will manage the applicable IBM Customer Order back logs. These             include but are not limited to AAS, EOSE, GEMS, IPRs, Q-Ship, MES             and others as defined by IBM. In conjunction with these IBM ordering             channels MSL will perform Order Desk responsibilities. MSL will             review all orders requesting delivery improvements, improving these             order to satisfy the customer required delivery dates given supply             continuity and available capacity. At [*] to IBM, MSL will accept             [*]. Deferments will be requested of MSL through the IBM ordering             systems mentioned above, or in writing from IBM. MSL will             reschedule the deferred orders to meet the requested ship dates.             In addition MSL will accept request to alter order content if Parts             and capacity are available. MSL will respond to all request to             improve, defer and/or alter orders in [*] Days. MSL agrees to             maintain the above mentioned IBM Customer Order backlogs keeping             these back logs up to date. MSL agrees to maintain local Order             Desk support in the geography specific Work Center.\n\n      c)    MSL agrees to perform materials requirement planning (\"MRP\") on top             level requirements input and acquire the appropriate Parts to             support Delivery Dates and IBM Customer Orders. This includes the             placing of purchase orders and/or IPRs on suppliers, some of which             may be IBM locations.\n\n      d)    Due to the high commonality of Parts in IBM's Products, MSL will             allow IBM to revise Product model mix as required. MSL will             acknowledge IBM's Product mix changes within [*] Days after receipt             of IBM's change notice.\n\n10.2  Schedule / On Time Delivery\n\n      a)    MSL will maintain [*] ([*]%) on time shipment. Specifically             Product(s) are to arrive in full at the Delivery Points on the             Delivery Date.\n\n      b)    MSL agrees to track and report on shipments/deliveries to IBM             customers per the IBM Customer Orders at the request of IBM.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 19 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n10.3  Delivery\n\n      a)    Title and risk of loss to Products shall pass to IBM at the time of             shipment from the Delivery Point unless otherwise stated in Section             15.0.\n\n      b)    If Product shipments are made prior to the Delivery Date without             IBM's prior written approval, IBM may elect to delay passage of the             title until the Delivery Date. If the delivery is late then transfer             of Product title will be made on the later date. In addition MSL             will not deliver Products in quantities in excess of those set forth             in on the IBM Customer Order, without IBM's prior written approval.\n\n10.4  Delays in Shipment\n\n      MSL shall notify IBM immediately of any anticipated late deliveries and       any impending plant or facility shut downs for any reasons. If MSL fails       to ship Product to the Delivery Point on schedule for any reason other       than Force Majeure or delays caused substantially by IBM, MSL shall ship       Product to the Delivery Point by air or in the most expeditious manner       possible. After MSL delivers Product to the Delivery Point, MSL will ship       Product to the designation stated on the IBM Customer Order by air or in       the most expeditious manner possible. MSL will be responsible for any       additional premium costs associated with the late shipment of Product       not only to the [*] but also to the [*] stated on the IBM Customer       Order.\n\n10.5  Shipment Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n      a)    The prices set forth in Section 7.0 Product Price include MSL's out             of pocket costs for freight, duty, customs, clearance, and             appropriate insurance, and any other costs related to the shipment,             export, or import of the Products before delivery to IBM. The cost             are the responsibility of MSL. The method of transportation shall be             suitable surface or air transport to the Delivery Point, Customer             location, or point of entry sufficient to meet IBM's Delivery Date.             The Product Attachment(s) shall state the Delivery Points.\n\n      b)    MSL shall arrange shipment with IBM carriers that will deliver             product to the destination on the IBM Customer Order in time for the             product to arrive on the committed arrival date which is stated on             the Customer Order. MSL shall utilize IBM carriers for all outbound             shipments, unless prior written approval from IBM to do otherwise.             IBM's approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Contractual             conflict with IBM carriers, or added IBM cost are some, but not all,             reasonable causes for denial of IBM approval.\n\nSECTION 11.0 PRODUCT FORECAST\n\n11.1  MSL agrees to participate in the IBM supply and demand process adhering to       the IBM EMLS corporate calendar. MSL will utilize the EMLS regen and or       provide the input into EMLS to insure a successful supply and demand       interlock. The EMLS regen must include all part numbers consumed in the       Charlotte Work Center.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 20 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n11.2  Each month IBM will provide MSL, one rolling [*] month forecast by machine       type, model, and by geography. This forecast will be MSL's authorization       to order/purchase Parts only for the fulfillment of orders, in accordance       to the IBM published lead-times for such materials. Products shall be       produced and delivered according to actual intake of IBM Customer Orders.       MSL will participate in the process of requirements planning by giving the       best Product supply projection and participating in cross functional       meetings when required.\n\n      The following will apply:\n\n      a)    The forecast will contain anticipated Delivery Dates for specified             quantities of machine types, models and geographies and lead-time             profile updates, as required, for specific Parts.\n\n      b)    MSL will notify IBM within [*] Days of receipt of a forecast if MSL             is unable to meet the quantities and Delivery Dates. If MSL fails to             notify IBM within the [*] Days, MSL will be deemed to have accepted             the quantities and Delivery Dates and will be bound by them;             provided, however, that MSL's actual or deemed acceptance of any             forecast shall be subject to the availability of IBM Parts and IBM             Designated Parts as needed, and MSL shall not be subject to any             penalties (and IBM shall not be able to reject any proposed             rescheduling of Delivery Dates) under this Agreement for failure to             meet Delivery Dates due to the unavailability of such Parts at the             times necessary to meet Delivery Dates, provided further however             that such unavailability of IBM Parts or IBM Designated Parts is not             due to MSL's failure to properly order such Parts or otherwise             properly manage its relationship with the provider of such Parts.\n\n      c)    If MSL notifies IBM that it cannot meet the quantities and Delivery             Dates in IBM's forecast, MSL's notification will include the             quantities MSL can deliver within the forecast's Delivery Dates and             proposed schedule of Delivery Dates for delivering the quantities             MSL cannot deliver within the forecast. IBM shall notify MSL in             writing, within [*] Days of receipt of MSL's notification, of its             decision either, in its sole discretion to:\n\n            i)    agree to the quantities and Delivery Dates in MSL's                   notification, which will then become binding upon both                   parties; or\n\n            ii)   agree to the quantities that will meet the forecast's Delivery                   Dates, which will then become binding on both parties, and                   either begin good faith negotiations with MSL to resolve any                   shortfall or reject MSL's proposed schedule for the remaining                   quantities; or provided, however that IBM may not reject MSL's                   proposed schedules if the reason for MSL's inability to meet                   the Delivery Dates is directly attributable to a breach of                   this Agreement by IBM. MSL may, with IBM's prior written                   approval and at MSL's expense, employ another manufacturer for                   the quantities that MSL cannot deliver within the forecast for                   the affected products. Notwithstanding any other term of this                   Agreement, if IBM rejects all or any part of MSL's proposal,                   IBM shall also be free to seek\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 21 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  another manufacturer (internally or externally) for the                   quantities MSL can not deliver within the forecast for the                   affected Products.\n\n            iii)  If good faith negotiations fail to resolve the shortfall                   within [*] Days, IBM shall have the option to reject MSL's                   whole proposal.\n\n      d)    The forecasts provided by IBM, or agreed to by IBM hereunder, do not             obligate IBM to purchase any Product.\n\n11.3  Feature Forecast\n\n      a)    MSL agrees to perform all feature forecasting as part of their             responsibilities. MSL agrees to forecast features in full support of             the requirements forecast that IBM passes at a machine type level             per Section 11.1 above.\n\n      b)    MSL will notify IBM within [*] Days of receipt of the monthly             requirements forecast, at the machine type level, if MSL is unable             to support the features necessary to meet the Delivery Dates of the             machine types per Section 11.1 above of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 12.0 ENGINEERING CHANGE\n\n      a)    MSL is required to inform IBM of any necessary or required EC which             would be applicable to the Products in general. In no event shall             MSL make any changes or incorporate any modification to Products             without the prior written agreement of IBM.\n\n      b)    IBM may, at its option, propose ECs to the Products to be delivered,             in which event MSL will be notified in writing. MSL agrees that IBM             shall have the right to require the incorporation of such ECs and             MSL shall, within [*] Days of such notification, give to IBM a             written evaluation of EC stating the cost increase or cost decrease             to the Products. In addition, this evaluation should include, but is             not limited to, MSL's evaluation of the ECs effect on the inventory,             delivery schedules and impact effect on function, reliability and             performance of Products. If such evaluation cannot be completed             within such period, notice to this effect shall be given by MSL as             soon as MSL learns that such evaluation cannot be completed and in             no event later than the [*] Days following notification. MSL will             give IBM a future completion date and reason for delay in such             notice.\n\n      c)    Upon completion of MSL's evaluation, IBM and MSL agree that 1) MSL             will implement the EC after MSL has received IBM's consent in             writing to the mutually agreed upon cost and delivery schedule, 2)             MSL will provide additional information that IBM may reasonably             require to further evaluate the EC, or 3) IBM will cancel the             specific EC.\n\n      d)    ECs will be brought to the attention of MSL via Engineering Change             Notifications (ECNs), that may have various forms, and may come from             IBM or IBM designated parties. However, the ECN is not an             authorization to execute the change. Upon receipt of an ECN, MSL             will respond by quoting the cost of that EC to IBM. MSL will not             implement any EC without an explicit authorization from IBM to             implement it.

Appendix             5 contains requirements for EC process flow and EC cycle times.\n\n      e)    MSL will process ECs according to IBM rules and specific IBM             requirements, and will enter corresponding data in EC application             systems. MSL will need to have the capability to receive IBM             development released ECs in both the Charlotte Work Center and the             Valencia Work Center.\n\n      f)    EC administration cost are included in the prices as defined in             Section 7.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.0 INVENTORY\n\n      a)    MSL is fully responsible for inventory ownership, excluding             consigned inventory, however MSL agrees to manage all inventories.             MSL will manage the material in the supply pipeline, as well as own             and manage work in process and finished goods until shipment of the             Product to the IBM Customer Order. On the Effective Date, MSL will             accept responsibility and liability for all open purchase orders and             IPRs for Parts, excluding Consigned Parts, which are required by             Products listed in the Product Attachments. MSL owns inventory,             excluding consignment, until title transfer at the time of shipment.             IBM will not be responsible for any associated carrying costs,             warehousing costs, excess and or scrap of MSL owned inventory. If             requested by IBM, MSL will subcontract to IBM the scrapping of Parts             owned by MSL. Actual costs charged to IBM by certified scrap             suppliers for the scrapping of Parts owned by MSL will be invoiced             by IBM to MSL.\n\n      b)    MSL will control all inventories in support of this Agreement per             IBM's guidelines concerning value classified parts, IBM Document             CP10.13.\n\n      c)    MSL will also be responsible for the data management necessary to             separate IBM consigned inventory from MSL inventory within the same             facility and systems.\n\n      d)    MSL will perform Rotating Inventory Audits and Counts (RIA/RIC) on             IBM consigned inventory in compliance to IBM's instructions.\n\n      e)    MSL and IBM will review inventory monthly, during this review MSL             will provide a written report that includes the items detailed under             Inventory in the Performance Appendix.\n\n      f)    MSL prices include charges for MSL inventory management and             ownership. Both parties agree that IBM has no liability for             inventories that MSL purchases for the purposes of this contract,             providing that forecast (requirements) accuracy is equal to or             greater than the level defined in Appendix 2. If Requirements             Accuracy falls below [*]% liabilities for any machine type for any             quarter, IBM will compensate MSL according to the method describe in             Appendix 2.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 23 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n13.1  Consigned Products\n\n      a)    MSL acknowledges that it will manage inventory consigned to MSL by             IBM.

In the case of Integration consigned inventory will be             stored and identified in logistics and physically by customer             account.\n\n      i)    Work labor and materials applied to the management of the consigned             inventory by MSL in the course of the performance of this Agreement             shall be paid for by IBM, as defined in Section 7.0, in accordance             with the terms of this Agreement and shall not at any time give rise             to any claim over the consigned Products. MSL hereby waives any             rights it may have to claim any liens against consigned Products.\n\n      j)    MSL will handle the scrapping of IBM consigned inventory per IBM's             guidelines concerning scrap.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 24 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n13.2  Supply Flexibility\n\n      a)    MSL will ensure flexibility for volumes, as specified in the Supply             Flexibility Appendix 4.\n\n      b)    Quarterly, MSL will update IBM on progress in improving Supplier             Flexibility.\n\n      c)    IBM will use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer LSS and SSS             arrangements with IBM suppliers to MSL.\n\n      d)    [*] months before EOL, MSL and IBM will agree on a transition plan             to regulate the flexibility.\n\n      e)    Cost of the Supply Flexibility as defined in Appendix 4 is included             in Product pricing per Section 7.0. IBM will have no liability for             unused flexibility.\n\n13.3  End of Life (\"EOL\") Inventory\n\n      a)    IBM agrees to share an annual plan with quarterly updates on product             EOL activity. Included will be the following scheduled events:             product withdrawal, end of manufacture, and transfer to IBM, if             applicable.\n\n      b)    MSL agrees to provide inventory planning support and squared set             analysis on these inventories participating in EOL activities prior             to any transfer to IBM. Any inventories not transferred to IBM will             remain the sole responsibility of MSL.\n\n13.4  Sale of Inventory\n\n      MSL agrees not to sell excess or surplus inventory purchased by MSL in       support of this Agreement without the prior written approval of IBM which       shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nSECTION 14.0 INTEGRATION\n\n14.1  Overview\n\n      The typical Integration consists of: assembly, unit testing, code load,       system test, personalization, repackaging and distribution.\n\n14.2  Customer Integration Statement of Work (Integration SOW)\n\n      IBM will provide MSL with a work scope for Integration for each       Integration project. Based on the work scope, MSL will provide IBM with a       SOW and the associated direct labor hours. This will be the base from       which future modification to the individual SOW will be based.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 25 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n14.3  MSL Account Coordinator\n\n      The account coordinator is the primary interface with IBM project managers       and/or customers for the delivery of Integration Products. This person       will be responsible for insuring that the necessary IBM Products which are       delivered by MSL are on order, that a roll out schedule is received by       MSL, the necessary consigned Products are received in sufficient time       prior to their need in the Integration process and/or delivery to the       customer, the required software is received, the line processes are in       place, the necessary pilots have been performed and the work is properly       scheduled on the line to insure an on time delivery. They are the prime\n\n\n\n\n\n      contact for problem resolution, issues, concerns, delivery tracking and       all other issues which affect customer satisfaction.\n\n14.4  Responsibilities\n\n      a)    IBM will be responsible for defining the process to be used on the             Integration line, for the assembly and test of those Products being             customized, tested or passed through the process. MSL will be             responsible for defining the process to be used on the Integration             line, for the code load and system test of units requiring this             work.\n\n      b)    MSL will be responsible for the implementation and execution of             these processes. MSL will be responsible for maintaining the             necessary technical support to implement these processes and             identify problems in the integration process. Process deficiencies             will be brought to the attention of the IBM Integration program             manager staff for resolution. Deficiencies realized due to customer             provided items will be resolved directly with the customer through             the MSL account coordinator or by the technical staff, whichever is             appropriate.\n\n      c)    MSL will own the entire manufacturing and delivery process and be             the sole interface with the customer (IBM and/or end user) through             the account coordinators.\n\n14.5  Inventory Management\n\n      a)    Provide a secure environment for the management and control of             consigned Products. This area should be fenced, with limited access             and within a reasonable distance from the manufacturing area and the             receiving docks.\n\n      b)    An automated inventory management system must be used to track             receipts, disposition and balance on hand at any point in time.             Information required by IBM personnel performing project management             activities for customers will be provided on an 'as required' basis             and will be readily available to such personnel. This inventory must             be labeled (bar coded) and separated by customer.\n\n      c)    Physical inventory counts are to be performed as needed for all             consigned inventory, for each customer, counted at least every [*]             Days with a accuracy target of [*]. This target is based on the             delta between the actual inventory count and the inventory             management system. Discrepancies are to identified, root cause             analysis performed, results reported (quarterly) and corrective             actions initiated. MSL is responsible for the cost associated with             the replacement of IBM and/or IBM customer\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 26 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            consigned Products which have been received by MSL and need to be             replaced as the result of theft or negligence.\n\n      d)    All consigned inventory is the responsibility of MSL until Delivery.\n\n14.6  Manufacturing\n\n      a)    The integration line should use a line control system that ties to             an automated ordering system that provides order accuracy, tracking,             disposition and history. The work environment should be kept             presentable and organized and available for customer tours.\n\n      b)    Incomplete shipments, with the customer approval, should use a             deviation process and be documented with the customer authorization.\n\n      c)    The manufacturing process must continue to use the line break in,             pilot and certification process currently in use unless mutually             agreed to in writing.\n\n14.7  On Site Repairs\n\n      a)    The consigned Product set may include both IBM and non-IBM Products,             new as well as used which may or may not be covered by a new product             warranty, IBM maintenance or another maintenance provider. In the             case of IBM logo Products, MSL will initiate repair of these             Products in the most cost effective and efficient manner. In the             case of repairs required to be performed by the third party             maintainers, MSL will provide a suitable work area for these repairs             and ensure that the necessary security requirements are met when             visited by non IBM personnel. When consigned Product defects are to             be returned to the manufacturer for either repair/replacement, MSL             will control this process.\n\n      b)    Out of box failures of RS Products will be replaced from inventory             or repaired as directed by IBM. These replacements are to be given             priority over new orders during times of product constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.8  Packaging\n\n      Integrated machines may require unique packaging based on their       configuration and the individual customers requirement. MSL will design       these boxes in accordance with IBM design criteria to insure that they       provide maximum protection against in route damage. All shipping       containers must be labeled in accordance with the guidelines outlined in       the Section 16.0 Packaging and in addition to any unique labeling customer       requirements.\n\n14.9  Security\n\n      a)    Sufficient security must be provided for work in process items,             customer and MSL/IBM provided. In addition, secured spaces will be             required from time to time for individual customers depending on the             nature of the work. Currently there is a contractual requirement for             secured space to perform the US Postal Service, hard drive, code             load program.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 27 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      b)    All reasonable precautions must be exercised to prevent unauthorized             access, use, modification, tampering or theft of software and             hardware consigned to MSL for the execution of Integration. Also,             these precautions must prevent unauthorized access to a customer's             remote system used in the performance of Integration.\n\n14.10 Scheduling\n\n      Product orders placed on MSL by IBM, in most cases, the CRAD (Customer       Required Arrival Date) will tie to the Integration roll out delivery date.       In those cases where there is a difference, MSL will validate the correct       delivery date with the IBM project manager. If an improvement or deferral       is required in the Product build schedule and based on Product       availability, MSL will schedule the Product build to insure arrival by the       required CRAD.\n\n14.11 Delivery\n\n      MSL will maintain [*] percent ([*]%) on time delivery, measured against       the CRAD date in the integration roll out schedule. Due to the nature of       the integration orders, there is no [*] option, unless agreed to prior to       shipment by the IBM project manager and/or the customer.\n\n14.12 Customer Satisfaction\n\n      Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of MSL. IBM will measure the       customer satisfaction via surveys. MSL commits to a customer satisfaction       target of [*]. This will be a reflection of MSLs on time deliveries,       flexibility in meeting the customers unplanned requirements, the quality       of the services performed and MSL's relationship, in general with IBM's       customers. The customer set will include the IBM Global Services project       managers and IBM's customers.\n\n14.13 Integration Quality\n\n      The service being performed is to be of high quality and free from process       defects. The target objective will be [*]%, measured monthly. MSL will be       responsible for the repair and/or replacement of Parts and Products which       have been damaged during the performance of the Integration. MSL will be       responsible for cost incurred by IBM as a direct result of MSL's failure       to follow the Integration procedures subject to the limitations contained       in Section 15.3 of the Base Agreement.\n\n14.14 Price\n\n      a)    IBM will establish a list of those items which are standard             components of the Integration process. IBM and MSL will agree upon             an execution time and a price, as stated in Section 7.2 b), for each             standard item. Integration requirements outside of these standard             items will be individually determined. Once these prices for these             standard items are established they will remain in effect during             the entire term of this Agreement.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 28 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n\n\n\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      b)    MSL will be responsible to track items which are beyond the             individual Integration SOW being executed when performed at IBM's             request and provide sufficient documentation to support the price             along with IBM's authorization of the added cost. MSL will invoice             IBM weekly for these costs. In those cases when a specific request             becomes standard, or a change in effort is requested by a customer,             a revision to the Integration SOW will be made and the contracted             price between IBM and MSL will be updated.\n\n      c)    MSL will be responsible for any cost beyond the agreed to [*] if             these costs were within the control of MSL.\n\n14.15 Transportation\n\n      a)    Premium outbound transportation may be used when requested by a             customer. In these cases, MSL must provide sufficient documentation             of the customer approval, and to support the cost.\n\n      b)    If premium outbound transportation is necessary due to MSL's             failure to ship on time, this cost is the responsibility of MSL             and IBM will invoice MSL for these costs.\n\n14.16 Integration SOW Completion\n\n      At the completion of an individual Integration SOW, a complete       reconciliation will be completed within 60 Days. This reconciliation will       be between MSL and the IBM project manager/customer and will include, but       not limited to, an inventory reconciliation, any outstanding cost and       disposition of all customer software and hardware in MSL's possession.\n\n14.17 Equipment\n\n      IBM will identify the current equipment, owned by IBM, needed to perform       Integration and it will be made available to MSL at an agreed to price per       Attachment 3 of the Base Agreement. If, at any time, MSL chooses to       replace Integration support equipment and the associated programs, IBM's       written concurrence will be required.\n\n14.18 Restrictions and Limitations\n\n      Nothing in this Agreement authorizes MSL to use any of IBM's tangible,       real or intangible property for the performance of any services       contemplated hereunder on IBM Logo products or for Integration services of       non-IBM Logo products related to a customer for whom Integration is being       provided by IBM. In any event, MSL will ensure that the IBM customer       delivery schedules will not be impacted based on other performance       obligations it may have during the term of the Agreement.\n\n14.19 Measurements/Reports\n\n      a)    MSL will be required to provide IBM with monthly reports detailing             their performance in relation to these Integration.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 29 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            These monthly report should provide at a minimum:\n\n            i)    On time delivery\n\n            ii)   Quality\n\n            iii)  Inventory management\n\n      b)    The specific targets are covered in this document under their             appropriate sections. These measurements should include a root cause             analysis, MSL actions to resolve and an action plan to achieve the             targeted objectives when there are deficiencies.\n\nSECTION 15.0 DROP SHIPMENTS\n\n      MSL will complete processes required to meet the following obligations       within [*] Days following the Effective Date.\n\n      a)    For Drop Shipments to IBM, MSL will be responsible for all             activities required to deliver the Products to the destination port             of the IBM company in the destination country. MSL will issue an IBM             invoice to the destination IBM company on behalf of the IBM business             area invoiced by MSL for these deliveries. MSL will ensure that             invoices and other required documentation are ready at the             destination port for timely importation into the country, but, MSL             will not be responsible for importation into the destination\n\n\n\n\n\n            country.\n\n      b)    For Drop Shipments in AP, MSL will transfer title to IBM when             Products are in \"highseas\" and after MSL has exported them through             the customs of the country of origin of the goods.\n\n      c)    For Drop Shipments to IBM customers, MSL will be responsible for all             activities required to deliver products to the customer in the             destination country, independently of when MSL transfers title of             property to IBM. MSL will be responsible for importation into the             destination country and delivery of Products to the customer after             clearing customs in that country. MSL will provide information to             IBM to allow IBM to issue an invoice to the final customer.\n\n      d)    For Drop Shipments to IBM US or IBM CANADA customers, MSL will             transfer title to IBM at the port of entry at USA or CANADA after             MSL has imported them through USA or CANADA customs.\n\n      e)    MSL will ensure timely distribution operations, irrespective of             whether MSL or another subcontractor is selected for outbound             distribution.\n\n      f)    MSL will comply with the IBM Import/Export Operation Application and             Instructions.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 30 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\nSECTION 16.0 PACKAGING\n\n      MSL must meet requirements of IBM specification GA219261.

IBM may reject any units of             Product which it finds in good faith not to meet the specifications             of this Agreement in any material respects. IBM should perform             incoming inspection within [*] Days after receipt of goods by IBM.             If IBM has not notified MSL of any defects in a unit of Product             within [*] Days of receipt, such unit shall\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 32 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            be deemed to be accepted. Acceptance by IBM of Product shall not             relieve MSL of any responsibility for latent non-conformance with             IBM specifications, fraud, negligence, title defects, or             infringement or warranty. Failure by IBM to perform testing shall             not be construed as a waiver to later asserting claims based on such             above mentioned defects.\n\n      b)    Acceptance of new Products by IBM shall not occur until a letter             documenting acceptance and any conditions of acceptance has been             issued to MSL by IBM. New Products are not subject to the [*] Day             from receipt requirement defined in the preceding paragraph.\n\n18.1  Nonconforming Acceptance\n\n      a)    IBM may choose to accept Products which fail to conform to the\n\n\n\n\n\n            specifications established in a Product Attachment without prejudice             to its right to reject nonconforming items in the future. If IBM so             chooses, IBM will notify MSL of its intent to accept nonconforming             items. MSL agrees to negotiate in good faith a price reduction for             such items based upon IBM's reasonable added expense to correct and             otherwise deal with such deficiencies. After the parties agree on a             price, IBM will notify MSL that IBM has accepted the nonconforming             items. No items for which IBM has issued a notice of nonconformance             shall be deemed accepted, except as provided in the first sentence             of this Section.\n\n      b)    IBM's payments for Products shall not signify that IBM has accepted             Product.\n\nSECTION 19.0 WARRANTY\n\n19.1  Scope of Warranty\n\n      a)    MSL expressly warrants that all Products, MSL supplied materials and             Parts, and work prepared for IBM will conform in all material             respects to the specifications, drawings, or other descriptions             furnished or adopted by IBM, and will be of specified quality, good             workmanship, and free from defect subject to the following terms:\n\n            i)    MSL's warranty for IBM Designated Parts will be as long as,                   and will be on the same terms and conditions as the Parts                   supplier's warranty stated in the relevant purchasing                   contract.\n\n            ii)   MSL will not provide a warranty for IBM Parts. However, MSL                   will provide Failure Analysis for such parts. MSL will process                   such failed Parts as \"Return to MSL for credit to IBM\" in a                   timely manner.\n\n            iii)  MSL will not provide a warranty for consigned Products.                   However, MSL will provide failure analysis for such Products.                   MSL will process such failed Products per IBM's instruction in                   a timely manor.\n\n            iv)   MSL will warrant all MSL Procured Parts for [*] months unless                   otherwise stated in the applicable Product Attachment, or                   agreed to by IBM in writing.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 33 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            v)    MSL will warrant its workmanship for [*] months unless other                   stated in the applicable Product Attachment.\n\n      b)    All of the above described warranty periods will commence on the             date that the Products containing the above Parts are delivered to             IBM. The above warranties shall survive acceptance test, and IBM's             Product test procedure. MSL's warranty described above also covers             latent defects resulting from MSL's specification, workmanship,             process, and/or Parts purchased from MSL's suppliers and IBM's             Nominated Suppliers.\n\n19.2  Defective Field Replaceable Units\n\n      a)    A defective FRU shall be a FRU that does not conform in all material             respects to that Product's particular specifications.\n\n      b)    IBM will return defective FRUs that are under warranty to MSL             freight collect. MSL will perform Failure Analysis and incoming             inspection and testing as described in the applicable Product             Attachment for FRU's rejected or returned to MSL which are still             under warranty. If the rejected FRU passes all inspection and test             criteria, the FRU shall be classified as NDF and such FRU shall be             returned to IBM freight collect.\n\n19.3  Exclusions\n\n      The warranty set forth above specifically excludes and does not apply to       defects caused by a) the use or operation of the Product in an application       or environment other than as described in or contemplated by the       specifications issued by IBM or b) IBM or the end user through misuse,       excessive shock or improper maintenance procedures.\n\n19.4  Title\n\n      MSL warrants that the title to all Products purchased by and delivered to       a Delivery Point under this Agreement shall be free and clear of all       liens, encumbrances, security interests or other adverse interests or       claims. Title and risk of loss shall pass from MSL to IBM at time of       shipment per the IBM Customer Order, unless otherwise stated in Section       10.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.5  Returned Product Turn Around Time\n\n      MSL shall set an objective to complete Failure Analysis, repair or       replacement of defective Products, within [*] Days after receipt from IBM.       Upon or before the [*] Day, MSL will ship the repaired or replaced       Product, to IBM at MSL's expense. If repair or replacement is not       possible, MSL will refund to IBM, MSL's price associated with the failed       Product, that is under warranty and the price paid by IBM to MSL or any       third parties or the intercompany transfer price for IBM Parts, for all       Parts, if the price of such Parts were not included in MSL's price.\n\n19.6  Implied Warranties\n\n      a)    MSL'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 19 ARE IN LIEU             OF AND ENTIRELY REPLACE ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO             THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, CONFORMANCE TO\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 34 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            SPECIFICATION AND/OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OF THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY             EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.\n\n      b)    IBM'S WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN AND ANY PRODUCT ATTACHMENT WITH             RESPECT TO PARTS, IF ANY, ARE IN LIEU OF AND ENTIRELY REPLACE ALL             OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY,             CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND/OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE WHETHER             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY             EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.\n\n19.7  Epidemic Failure\n\n      In the case where any specific Product, shipped to IBM from MSL within any       [*] month experiences a defect rate of [*]% or greater, resulting from a       common cause due to MSL's non-conformance to specifications, drawings,       other descriptions furnished or adopted by IBM, or due to workmanship, MSL       will accept the cost of a Product Recall.\n\nSECTION 20.0 COMMON TOOLING\n\n      Tools commonly used in production and/or Integration will be owned and       managed by MSL.\n\nSECTION 21.0 TOOLING TO BE ACQUIRED\n\n21.1  Purchase\n\n      a)    MSL will submit requests for additional tooling, if any, quarterly             for inclusion in IBM's capital request process.\n\n      b)    MSL shall not purchase any tooling or other capital equipment on             IBM's account without IBM's prior written approval.\n\n            i)    If specifically required in a Product Attachment, IBM will                   supply tooling for Products to MSL. It shall be IBM's option                   whether the tooling will be consigned by IBM to MSL or                   purchased by MSL.\n\n            ii)   If IBM elects to have MSL purchase tooling, MSL shall be                   responsible for the design, cost and build of all new or                   replacement tooling which shall be capable of producing                   Product in accordance with the IBM specification in the                   Product Attachment. MSL warrants that the tooling used under                   this Agreement shall be capable of producing the quantity of                   Product as specified by IBM.\n\n            iii)  If IBM elects to have MSL purchase the tooling, MSL shall                   invoice IBM for the cost of such tooling at such time as the                   tooling is placed into service. The cost of such tooling                   includes, but is not limited to, the cost of any purchased                   components (including parts and complete items), fully                   burdened MSL engineering and/or manufacturing labor use in the                   design and/or construction of such tools, duties, insurance,                   transportation, installation, costs and costs of\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 35 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  money, if any. MSL agrees that MSL engineering will be priced                   to IBM on a \"most favored customer\" basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n            iv)   Both parties may agree to amortize the tooling and shall put                   such agreement in writing and any terms and conditions                   associated with such amortization. If IBM and MSL agree to                   amortize the tooling, IBM agrees to pay for the tooling and                   any associated carrying cost agreed to between the Parties via                   an amortization charge in addition to the respective Product                   price as defined in Section 7.0. The amortization period for                   each tool will be stated in the applicable Product Attachment                   and shall be triggered by the initial delivery of the                   Product(s) for which the tooling expenses are incurred.\n\n                  IBM will state the estimated ship quantity and maximum monthly                   ship rate for the amortization period. MSL will define the                   total tooling cost to support the maximum ship rate. The total                   tooling cost will be divided by the estimated ship quantity                   provided by IBM. This unit amortization cost will be itemized                   in MSL's quotes as \"tooling adder\".\n\n            v)    The tooling cost recovery, via the \"tooling adder\", will be                   analyzed during each quarterly review meeting between IBM and                   MSL. The intent is to adjust the \"tooling adder\" based upon                   volume changes, such that the total tooling cost will be                   recovered by the end of the amortization period. If at the end                   of the amortization period the tooling cost have been over or                   under recovered, an adjustment invoice will be processed                   accordingly.\n\n      c)    MSL acknowledges and agrees that its utilization of any tooling for             other customers will not impact IBM's product requirements. MSL will             obtain IBM's written approval prior to entering into a contract with             a third party involving tooling for Products listed in the Product             Attachment.\n\n      d)    In the event that MSL owns the tooling and has received a bona fide             third party offer to purchase any or all of the tooling, before MSL             may accept such offer, MSL shall notify IBM in writing, and IBM             shall have [*] Days after such notice to agree to purchase such             tooling on the same terms and conditions as such third party offer.\n\n      e)    All tools, dies, jigs, patterns, equipment or Parts purchased,             furnished, charged to or paid for by IBM and any replacement thereof             shall become and remain the property of IBM. IBM agrees to provide             MSL appropriate technical support for IBM owned tooling at no charge             to MSL. IBM shall have the option of removing IBM owned tooling from             MSL directly, depending upon Product strategy and production.\n\n21.2  Care\n\n      MSL is responsible for protection, calibration, maintenance and care of       all tooling owned by IBM and shall be liable for loss or damage of such       tooling while in MSL's possession or control. IBM agrees to insure tooling       it owns. Where possible, MSL will be jointly insured with respect to the       IBM owned tooling for its interest. This tooling shall be subject to       inspection by IBM upon notice and shall be returned in an acceptable       condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, upon demand or notice by       IBM.

The Forecast represents the requirements that was passed by IBM [*] months prior, for the total volume by machine type for the quarter that is being measured. Actual Order Load represents the final amount of orders scheduled for the quarter being measured. For example when measuring the [*] for the first quarter in 1998 you would calculate [*] by taking the [*] that was passed [*] for the first [*] in [*] and subtract the actual [*] for that [*]. Then divide by the forcast and multiply by [*]. You follow the same methodology for [*] looking at the forecast [*] months prior to the last month of the quarter being measured. Once [*] through [*] is calculated you apply these results to the formula above.\n\n                                       [*]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formula measures the accuracy of requirements placed on MSL for a given quarter, each month, starting [*] months prior to the end of the quarter, using a [*] weighted calculation.\n\nThe following percentages will be multiplied by the material cost of the volume of the machine type shipped in the quarter that fell below [*]% of the Requirements Accuracy calculation.\n\n            REQUIREMENTS ACCURACY          INCREMENTAL %             AS DEFINED ABOVE               APPLIED TO MATERIAL COST                                                         [*] and Greater                  [*]%                Less than [*]%                   [*]%\n\nPayments for these liabilities will be made via a separate invoice.\n\nIBM and MSL Confidential                                           Page 3 of 7\n\nAPPENDIX 3: PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS\n\nThe following SPECIFICATIONS apply to MSL services at each work center:\n\nMeasurement                              Period           Target ------------------------                 ------           ------                                                      On-time shipment (a)(c)                             [*] Responsiveness (b)(c) Order to ship leadtime (Pick&Pack) (d) Order to ship leadtime (Bulk) (d) Product quality Serviceability to IBM Plants Serviceability to IBM Services\n\n(a) Percentage of finished orders that are shipped from MSL and delivered to     IBM on the committed Delivery Date.

ADDITIONAL AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.\n\n        (a) During the Term of the Agreement, and for [*] years thereafter,     MSL agrees to keep all usual and proper records and books of account and     all usual and proper entries relating to each MS Software Image sufficient     to substantiate the number of copies of MS Software Image packages acquired     and placed into Product packages, the number of copies of MS Software Images     installed, and the number of Products distributed by MSL. MSL shall maintain     on MSL's premises (or commercial archive facility) such records, and all     other records required to be kept by this Attachment 6, for itself and for     each Subsidiary of MSL that exercises rights under this Attachment 6. Any     audit must be initiated within [*] years after termination or expiration of     this Attachment 6, the Agreement, or of the MS License, whichever occurs     last.\n\n        (b) In order to verify statements issued by MSL and Subsidiaries of MSL     and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Attachment 6, IBM or MS     may, at IBM's or MS's sole discretion, cause (i) an audit to be made of     MSL's and/or MSL's Subsidiaries' books and records and/or (ii) an inspection     to be made of those portions of MSL's and/or MSL's Subsidiaries' facilities     and procedures reasonably necessary to verify such compliance. Except as     otherwise provided in the Agreement, any audit and/or inspection shall be     conducted during regular business hours at MSL's and/or MSL's Subsidiaries'     facilities, with at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior written     notice. Any audit and/or inspection shall be conducted (other than on a     contingent fee basis) by an independent certified public accountant which is     either (1) jointly selected by MSL and IBM (or MS, as applicable), (2) has     been agreed to by the Parties for any prior audit of any MSL/IBM (or MS, as     applicable) license or agreement, or (3) has been agreed to by IBM and MS     for any prior audit of any IBM/MS license or agreement.\n\n        (c) MSL agrees to provide the audit or inspection team reasonable access     to the relevant MSL's and/or MSL's Subsidiaries' records and facilities for     the purpose of performing the audit.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                  June 2, 1999 ATT6.1wp                                                          Page 18 of 19\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 6                    SOFTWARE INSTALLATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                             EXHIBIT 5 OF APPENDIX A                            ADDITIONAL MS PROVISIONS:                       MS LICENSE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON MSL\n\n        (d) Prompt adjustment shall be made to compensate for any errors or     omissions disclosed by such audit. Any such audit shall be paid for by IBM     (or MS, as applicable) unless material discrepancies are disclosed.     \"Material\" shall mean an underaccounting of installed MS Software Images     valued at more than [*]. If material discrepancies are disclosed, MSL     agrees to pay IBM or MS for the costs associated with the audit. Further,     MSL agrees to indemnify IBM and its subsidiaries for any additional costs     incurred by IBM as a result of any unauthorized copies or copies which were     not reported to IBM. In no event shall audits be made more frequently than     semiannually unless the immediately preceding audit disclosed a material     discrepancy.\n\n5.  EXPORT OR RE-EXPORT. MSL agrees that it will not export or re-export an MS     Software Image to any country to which such export is restricted by export     administration regulations, without prior written consent, if required, of     the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or     such other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction over such export.     Restricted countries currently include, but are not necessarily limited to,     Cuba, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. MSL warrants and     represents that neither the U.S.A. Bureau of Export Administration nor any     other federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied MSL's export     privileges. MSL further agrees that it shall not export or re-export an MS     Software Image in violation of applicable laws or regulations to (i) any End     User who MSL knows will utilize an MS Software Image in the design,     development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or     (ii) any End User who has been prohibited from participating in U.S.A.     export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.A. government.\n\n6. CONFIDENTIALITY. As provided in the Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Attachment 6 (including this Exhibit 5 of Appendix A of Attachment 6) are confidential, and MSL shall not disclose the terms or conditions to any third\n\n\n\n\n\nparty without the prior written approval of IBM.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                  June 2, 1999 ATT6.1wp                                                          Page 19 of 19\n\n                           IBM AGREEMENT FOR EXCHANGE                           OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n                           Document Number: 4998S60076\n\n                   International Business Machines Corporation                              Armonk, New York 10504\n\n                                                                     Page 1 of 5\n\n                                                               [GRAPHIC OMITTED]\n\n               Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information\n\nIBM ============================================================================\n\n      Our mutual objective under this Agreement is to provide appropriate       protection for Confidential Information (Information) while maintaining       our ability to conduct respective business activities. Each of us agree       that the following terms apply when one of us (Disclose) discloses       Information to the other (Recipient) under this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 1 ASSOCIATED CONTRACT DOCUMENTS\n\n      Each time one of the parties wishes to disclose specific Information to       the other, the Discloser will issue a Supplement to this Agreement       (Supplement) before disclosure.\n\n      The Supplement will identify the Recipient's person designated to be its       Point of Contact for the disclosure and will contain the Initial and Final       Disclosure Dates. If either of these dates is omitted from the Supplement,       such date will be deemed to be the actual date of disclosure. Information       becomes subject to this Agreement on the Initial Disclosure Date. The       Supplement will also contain a non-confidential description of the       specific Information to be disclosed and any additional terms for that       Information.\n\n      The only time Recipient and Discloser are required to sign the Supplement       is when it contains additional terms. When signatures are not required,       the Recipient indicates acceptance of Information under the terms of this       Agreement by participating in the disclosure, after receipt of the       Supplement.\n\nSECTION 2 DISCLOSURE\n\n      The Discloser and Recipient's Point of Contact will coordinate and control       the disclosure. Information will be disclosed either:\n\n            1)    In writing;             2)    By delivery of items;             3)    By initiation of access to information, such as may be                   contained in a data base; or             4)    By oral and/or visual presentation.\n\n      Information should be marked with a restrictive legend of the Discloser.       If Information is not marked with such legend or is disclosed orally:\n\n            1)    The Information will be identified as confidential at the time                   of disclosure, and             2)    The Discloser will promptly provide the Recipient with written                   summary.\n\nSECTION 3 OBLIGATION\n\n      The Recipient agrees to:\n\n            1)    use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure,                   publication or dissemination of the Discloser's Information as                   it uses with its own similar Information that it does not wish                   to disclose, publish or disseminate; and             2)    use the Discloser's Information for the purpose for which it                   was disclosed or otherwise for the benefit of the Discloser.\n\n      The Recipient may disclose Information to:\n\n                                                                     Page 2 of 5\n\n            1)    its employees and employees of its parent and subsidiary                   companies who have a need to know; and             2)    any other party with the Discloser's prior written consent.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Before disclosure to any of the above parties, the Recipient will have a       written agreement with such party sufficient to require that party to       treat information in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n      The Recipient may disclose Information to the extent required bylaw.       However, the Recipient must give the Discloser prompt notice to allow the       Discloser a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order.\n\nSECTION 4 CONFIDENTIALITY PERIOD\n\n      Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the       terms of this Agreement for [*] years following the Final Disclosure Date.\n\nSECTION 5 EXCEPTIONS TO OBLIGATIONS\n\n      The Recipient may disclose, publish, disseminate, and use Information that       is:\n\n            1)    already in its possession without obligation of                   confidentiality;             2)    developed independently;             3)    obtained from a source other than the Discloser without                   obligation of confidentially;             4)    publicly available when received, or thereafter becomes                   publicly available through no fault of the Recipient; or             5)    disclosed by the Discloser to another party without obligation                   of confidentially.\n\nSECTION 6 RESIDUAL INFORMATION\n\n      The recipient may disclose, publish, disseminate, and use the ideas,       concepts, know-how and techniques, related to the Recipient's business       activities, which are contained in the Discloser's information and       retained in the memories of Recipient's employees who have had access to       the Information pursuant to this Agreement (Residual Information).\n\n      Nothing contained in this Section gives the Recipient the right to       disclose, publish, or disseminate, except as set forth elsewhere in this       Agreement:\n\n            1)    the source of Residual Information;             2)    any financial, statistical or personnel data of the                   Discloser; or             3)    the business plans of the Discloser.\n\nSECTION 7. DISCLAIMERS\n\n      THE DISCLOSER PROVIDES INFORMATION ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS.\n\n      The discloser will not be liable for any damages arising out of use of       Information disclosed hereunder.\n\n      Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure of Information hereunder grants       the Recipient any right or license under any trademark, copyright or       patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Discloser.\n\n      Disclosure of Information containing business plans is for planning       purposes only. The Discloser may change or cancel its plans at any time.       Use of such Information is at the Recipient's own risk.\n\n      The receipt of Information pursuant to this Agreement will not preclude,       or in any way limit, the Recipient from:\n\n                                                                     Page 3 of 5\n\n            1)    providing to others products or services which may be                   competitive with products or services of the Discloser;             2)    providing products or services to others who compete with the                   Discloser; or             3)    assigning its employees in any way it may choose.\n\nSECTION 8 GENERAL\n\n      This Agreement does not require either party to disclose or to receive       Information.\n\n      Neither party may assign, or otherwise transfer, its rights or delegate       its duties or obligations under this Agreement without prior written       consent. Any attempt to do so is void.\n\n      The Recipient will comply with all applicable United States and foreign       export laws and regulations.\n\n      Only a written agreement signed by both of us can modify this Agreement.\n\n      Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing [*] month's written       notice to the other. Any provisions of this Agreement which by their       nature extend beyond its termination remain in effect until fulfilled,       and apply to respective successors and assignees.\n\n\n\n\n\n      If there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a       Supplement, those of the Supplement prevail. Except as modified by a       Supplement, the terms of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.\n\n      The laws of the State of New York govern this Agreement.\n\n                                                                     Page 4 of 5\n\n      This Agreement and its Supplements are the complete and exclusive       agreement regarding our disclosures of Information, and replace any prior       oral written communications between us.

MSL's continued use of the Loaned Items or acceptance of       additional Loaned Items after its receipt of a revised Attachment 5 will       constitute its acceptance of such Attachment.\n\n      The loan of Loaned Items is made in conjunction with the IBM and MSL       Outsourcing Agreement dated _____________________ (\"Referenced       Agreement\") for the purpose of MSL fulfilling its responsibilities and       obligation as stated in the Reference Agreement.\n\nSECTION 2 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n      Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the EPLA will be in effect for as long       as the Referenced Agreement is effective.\n\nSECTION 3 LOANED PERIOD\n\n      IBM will provide the Loaned Items to MSL on or about the Effective Date of       the Referenced Agreement. The Loan Period for each Loaned Item will extend       from the actual date IBM delivers the Loaned Items(s) to MSL, until the\n\n\n\n\n\n      earliest of:\n\n      a)    the applicable return date specified in the Attachment or revised             return date specified in a revised Attachment;\n\n      b)    the date MSL acquires i) title to the Loaned Equipment or ii) a             continuing license to the Loaned Program, should such acquisition or             licensing be available to MSL under Section 12: or\n\n      c)    on the Referenced Agreement expiration date.\n\nSECTION 4 AUTHORIZED USE\n\n      IBM provides Loaned Items to MSL solely for use in accordance with the       terms of this Agreement and for the Purpose of the loan described either       in this Agreement or in the Referenced Agreement (Authorized Use). There       are no charges for Authorized Use of the Loaned Items. MSL may not use the       Loaned Items for any other purposes.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 2 of 7\n\nSECTION 5 OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE\n\n      IBM or another party retains title to all Loaned Items. MSL may not       transfer Loaned Items to anyone else. For Loaned Programs which are not       subject to IBM's or another supplier's or publisher's license agreement,       IBM grants MSL a license to use, store, modify and make sufficient copies       to support MSL's Authorized Use under this Agreement. Such copies will be       deemed to be Loaned Items. For Loaned Programs which are subject to       another supplier's or publisher's license agreement, however, the terms       and conditions of that supplier or publisher are passed to MSL through       IBM. Such terms and conditions will be shipped with the Loaned Program.       For Loaned Programs which IBM licenses to others under an IBM license, the       terms of the applicable IBM license which are not inconsistent with this       Agreement apply. IBM will provide such terms to MSL upon request Any       authorized copies made by MSL will be deemed to be Loaned Items.\n\nSECTION 6 LICENSED INTERNAL CODE\n\n      If the Loaned Equipment contains Licensed Internal Code (Code), so       identified by IBM, IBM grants MSL a license only to execute such Code to       enable the Loaned Equipment to perform in accordance with IBM's official       published specifications. MSL may not reverse assemble, reverse compile,       decode, translate, or make any other copies of the Code. MSL must return       the original copy of the Code to IBM at the conclusion of the Loan Period.\n\nSECTION 7 DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION\n\n      IBM will deliver the Loaned Items to 8501 IBM Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262.\n\n      MSL will:\n\n            1)    set-up all Loaned Equipment, and\n\n            2)    install all Loaned Programs\n\nSECTION 8 RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE\n\n      IBM relieves MSL of the risk of loss of, or damage to, all Loaned Items,       except for loss or damage resulting from MSL's breach of this Agreement       including use other than Authorized Use.\n\nSECTION 9 SECURITY\n\n      MSL will provide, at no cost to IBM, adequate security to protect the       Loaned Items from theft, damage or misuse.\n\n      MSL will use reasonable care in the use of all Loaned Items. MSL will       provide an operating environment for the Loaned Items consistent with the       related user documentation.\n\n      MSL will keep the Loaned Items at the Installation Address specified in       the Attachment. MSL will not move the Loaned Items to another location       without IBM's prior written approval.\n\nSECTION 10 SERVICE AND SUPPORT\n\n      During the time the Loaned Items are in MSL's possession, MSL shall, at       its own expense:\n\n      a)    Develop and maintain the expertise to operate the Equipment             independent of IBM and ensure that the Equipment complies at all             times with all federal, state, and local governmental safety and             other requirement (including OSHA regulations). If MSL determines             that any of the Loaned Items received from IBM fails to comply with             any such requirements, MSL shall promptly notify IBM, and IBM shall\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 3 of 7\n\n            either replace the Loaned Item or instruct MSL to modify the Loaned             Item so that it compiles, at IBM's expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n      b)    Service the Loaned Items and maintain them in good operating             condition at all times.\n\n      c)    Replace or repair all items lost, damaged or destroyed except to the             extent MSL proves to IBM that such loss, damage or destruction is             caused by circumstances beyond MSL's control. All replacement of             Loaned Items Shall become IBM property and shall be Subject to all             the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel full, free and safe access to MSL's       facilities, during normal business hours, after reasonable notice, for the       purpose of inspection and inventory as IBM deems necessary.\n\nSECTION 11 ALTERATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS\n\n      MSL may make an alteration to Loaned Equipment (e.g., a change in the       structure of the equipment) only upon IBM's prior written approval. MSL       may make an attachment to Loaned Equipment (e.g., coupling a printer to a       loaned personal computer) without notice to IBM.\n\n      MSL will remove any alteration or attachment and restore Loaned Equipment       to its unaltered condition before its return to IBM or upon IBM's notice       to MSL that the alteration or attachment creates a safety hazard or       renders maintenance of the Loaned Equipment impractical.\n\nSECTION 12 DISPOSITION OF LOANED ITEMS\n\n12.1  Return to IBM\n\n      MSL will return the Loaned Equipment to IBM at the end of the Loan Period,       except as may be provided for in this Section. MSL will return the Loaned       Equipment to IBM in the same condition as when delivered to MSL,       reasonable wear and tear excepted.\n\n      MSL will return the original and all copies of the Loaned Programs at the       end of the Loaned Period, except as may be provided in this Section.\n\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel access during IBM's normal business hours to       allow IBM to remove the Loaned Items.\n\n12.2  Acquisition and Continued Licensing\n\n      IBM will determine the availability of Loaned Equipment for MSL's       acquisition and Loaned Programs for MSL's continued licensing beyond the       applicable Loan Period. MSL must inform IBM, prior to the end of the       applicable Loan Period, of MSL's interest in the acquisition of specific       Loaned Equipment or the continued licensing of specific Loaned Programs.       IBM will then notify MSL in writing either;\n\n            1)    of the terms and conditions under which MSL may acquire such                   Loaned Equipment or continue to license such Loaned Programs,                   or\n\n            2)    that the Loaned Items are not available for acquisition or                   continued licensing.\n\n      Continued Licensing of Loaned Programs will be governed by the provisions       of the applicable IBM license agreement or another supplier's or       publisher's license agreement. IBM will identify to MSL the applicable       agreement which governs such licensing.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 4 of 7\n\nSECTION 13 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n\n      IBM PROVIDES LOANED ITEMS ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS. IBM MAKES NO WARRANTY,       EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nSECTION 14 PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS\n\n      If the operation of a Loaned Item becomes, or IBM believes is likely to       become, the subject of a claim that it infringes a patent or copyright in       the United States or Puerto Rico, MSL will permit IBM, at its option and       expense, either to secure the right for MSL to continue using the Loaned       Item or to replace or modify it so that it becomes noninfringing. However,       if neither of the foregoing alternatives is available on terms which are       reasonable in IBM's judgment, MSL will return the Loaned Item upon IBM's       written request.\n\n      IBM will have no obligation with respect to any such claim based upon       MSL's modification of IBM equipment, programs or programming or their       combination, operation or use with any non-IBM apparatus, data or       programs.\n\n      IBM will not have any liability regarding patent or copyright infringement       for non-IBM Loaned Items.\n\n      This Section states IBM's entire obligations to MSL regarding infringement       or the like.\n\nSECTION 15 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES\n\n\n\n\n\n      IBM's entire liability and MSL's exclusive remedy for actual damages from       cause whatsoever relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be       limited to the amount of $25,000. This limitation will apply, except as       otherwise stated in this Section, regardless of the form of action,       whether in contract or in tort, including negligence. This limitation will       not apply to claims by MSL for bodily injury or damage to real property or       tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable.\n\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any lost profits, lost savings,       incidental damages, or other economic consequential damages, even if IBM       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In addition, IBM will       not be liable for any damages claimed by IBM based on any third party       claim.\n\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any damages caused by MSL's failure to       perform MSL's responsibilities.\n\nSECTION 16 GENERAL\n\n      MSL may not assign this Agreement without IBM's prior written consent. Any       attempted assignment without such consent is void.\n\n      Loaned Items are to be installed only in the United States or Puerto Rico.\n\n      IBM will pay destination charges, both from and to IBM-designated       locations, for each Loaned Item shipped in accordance with IBM's then       current shipping practice. MSL will pay any rigging charges. MSL will       furnish all labor for unpacking and packing except as IBM otherwise       specifies or when performed at an IBM-designated location.\n\n      IBM may provide services described in this Agreement by using IBM-selected       independent contractors.\n\n      Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under       this Agreement due to causes beyond its control.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 5 of 7\n\n      Neither party may bring an action, regardless of form, arising out of this       Agreement more than [*] years after the cause of action arose.\n\n      In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the       provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, extend beyond the       expiration or termination of this Agreement shall remain in effect beyond       such expiration or termination until fulfilled.\n\n      If there is a conflict between this Agreement and an Attachment, the terms       and conditions of the Attachment will prevail. Except as modified by an       Attachment the terms of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.       The terms of any Attachment not inconsistent with a subsequent Attachment       remain in full force and effect.\n\n      This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall       be construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New       York.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 6 of 7\n\n      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be       executed by their respective authorized representatives.\n\n      ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:               ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:\n\n      IBM Corporation                       Manufacturers' Services Western                                             US Operations, Inc.       --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      By: /s/ Craig A.
