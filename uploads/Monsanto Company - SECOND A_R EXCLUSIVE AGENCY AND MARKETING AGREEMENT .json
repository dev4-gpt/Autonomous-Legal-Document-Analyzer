The Agent shall, on behalf of Monsanto, be responsible for all the bookkeeping for the Roundup L&G Business, which shall include, but not be limited to, (i) setting up a separate set of accounting records reflecting all the items of income, profit, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Roundup L&G Business, including a profit and loss statement (\"Roundup P&L\") and all other records relating to the Roundup L&G Business including sales invoices and customer data (the \"Roundup Records\") in accordance with the written set of accounting policies (including the currency exchange methodology used by Monsanto) as shall be provided by Monsanto; provided, that if any change in Monsanto's accounting policies would adversely affect the Agent's Commission (other than in a de minimis amount), the parties shall negotiate in good faith to change the thresholds and/or the Commission, as appropriate, to eliminate such adverse affect; (ii) collecting, recording and safeguarding receipts of all receivables and payables, costs or expenses either directly incurred by the Roundup L&G Business or Allocated thereto by either party pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3 hereof. At all times, the Agent shall make available via computer and/or original documentation, to the members of the Global Support Team continuous access to the Roundup Records as appropriate on a need-to-know basis, such access shall include, but not be limited to, daily sales updates and additional financial reporting with such detail as Monsanto may reasonably request from time to time.\n\n(b) Financial Reporting. The Agent shall provide Monsanto no later than the date that is the earlier of (i) four (4) business days after the last day of each of the Agent's fiscal months and (ii) the first business day of each calendar month (which corresponds to the first work day of Monsanto's closing period) a full, detailed report by country of the Roundup SKU's being sold during the past month, including but not limited to Monsanto SKU identifier, quantity sold, quantity of samples provided free of charge, total sales value by SKU (in local currency). The\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent shall provide to Monsanto monthly financial statements, including (i) the full Roundup P&L (from Gross Sales to EBIT), balance sheet and cash flow statements, (ii) the Netback expense detail (accruals and actuals), (iii) all other Expense detail (accruals and actuals), and (iv) Cost of Goods Sold detail. Such monthly financial statements shall be provided (i) in their preliminary form (due to the closing schedule, the parties acknowledge that these results may be preliminary or final and a subsequent true-up may occur in the following month) no later than the date that is the earlier of (i) four (4) business days after the last day of each of the Agent's fiscal months and (ii) the first business day of each calendar month (which corresponds to the first work day of Monsanto's closing period), and (ii) in their final form no later than ten (10) business days following the end of each calendar month.\n\n(c) Audit. Monsanto shall have the right to periodically audit or have an independent accountant audit, on Monsanto's behalf, all the Roundup Records. The audit shall be at the cost of Monsanto unless any material error has been committed by the Agent, in which case the Agent shall bear the cost of the audit. Upon exercise of its right of audit, and discovery of any disputed item, Monsanto shall provide written notice of dispute to the Agent. The parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.\n\nSection 3.2 Ordering, Invoicing and Cash Flow Cycle.\n\n(a) Ordering and Invoicing. The Agent shall perform, on behalf of Monsanto, all order taking, order processing and invoicing for the Roundup Products, it being understood that orders filled for Roundup Products shall be invoiced on the invoices used by the Agent for its other non-Roundup Products provided such invoices or their EDI version shall (i) identify the Agent as an agent for Monsanto for the sale of all Roundup Products and Monsanto as the actual transferor of title to Roundup Products; (ii) direct payment of such invoice to be made directly to the account designated by the Agent; and (iii) include all taxes (other than Income Taxes), duties, and other charges imposed by governmental authorities based on the production or sale of Roundup Products or their ownership or transportation to the place and time of sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Agent utilizes a third-party distributor, in circumstances as the Agent and Monsanto may agree, Monsanto may perform order taking, order processing and/or invoicing for the Roundup Products as the Agent and Monsanto may mutually agree.\n\n(b) Customer Remittances. Customers of Roundup Products shall be directed, as per the invoices, to remit directly the invoiced amounts for all Roundup Products to the Agent's designated bank account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to customers that are invoiced by Monsanto in accordance with Section 3.2(a), such customers of Roundup Products shall be invoiced directly by Monsanto and shall remit payment directly to Monsanto the invoiced amounts for all Roundup Products to an account designated by Monsanto.\n\n(c) Cash Settlement. At the end of each week, the Agent shall verify the actual amount of the Customers' remittances for the Roundup Products received and Expenses paid over the past week and shall send to Monsanto a weekly reconciliation statement (the \"Reconciliation Statement\") setting forth such information in the form attached hereto as Schedule 3.2(c). Within three business days (or such other time period agreed to by the Agent and Monsanto) of the receipt by Monsanto of the Reconciliation Statement, Monsanto shall review and approve such\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation Statement; provided, that (i) if Monsanto disputes the contents of the Reconciliation Statement, the Agent and Monsanto shall work in good faith to resolve any such disputes and (ii) any such dispute shall be reconciled and addressed by way of an adjustment to the cash settlement in the current month or a subsequent month, as mutually agreed to by the Agent and Monsanto. Upon the approval of the Reconciliation Statement (subject to any agreed to revisions), Monsanto or the Agent, as applicable, shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds the net amount due to the Agent or to Monsanto, as applicable. For the purpose of this Section 3.2(c), customer remittances shall be allocated by the Agent to Roundup Products in proportion to the amount payable by such customer to the Agent in relation Roundup Products to the total amount payable by such customer to the Agent.\n\n(d) Recognition. The parties acknowledge and agree that all sales by the Agent will be recognized for accounting purposes at the time when the product to be accounted for as sold has been shipped to the applicable account and its receipt confirmed. With respect to all buy/sell sales and all other direct account sales, whether by the Agent's sub-distributors or sub- agents, such sales will be recognized for accounting purposes at the time when the product to be accounted for as sold has been shipped to the applicable sub-distributor or sub-agent and its receipt confirmed. Any payments received by the Agent as Monsanto's agent for sales made in accordance with this Agreement will be remitted to Monsanto in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement as modified by the course of performance of the parties.\n\n(e) Budget. The budget for the Roundup L&G Business shall include both buy/sell sales and direct account sales.\n\nSection 3.3 Expenses and Allocation Rules\n\n(a) Expenses. Each and every Expense, either as a direct expense or an allocated one, shall only be charged to the Roundup L&G Business and consequently taken into account in the Program EBIT statements set forth in Section 3.6(c) hereto if part of a category of Expenses specifically authorized by the terms of the Annual Business Plan and within the aggregate amount prescribed in the Annual Business Plan for such category of Expense (\"Budget\") (\"Approved Expense\"). Any Expense which shall exceed its prescribed Budget shall solely be the responsibility of the party incurring it unless such expense is required to implement an approved Significant Deviation from the Annual Business Plan or is necessary to support sales orders above budgeted sales pursuant to sales programs contemplated by the Annual Business Plan. Expenses shall be classified into (i) direct expenses of the Roundup L&G Business payable to vendors, or (ii) as Allocated Expenses agreed upon during the Annual Business Plan. Payment of any direct expenses incurred by either party on behalf of the Roundup L&G business shall be made as they become due in accordance with the applicable commercial terms agreed upon with each vendor.\n\n(b) Expense Verification. Each party shall have the right to verify whether any particular Expense is an Approved Expense by sending a written inquiry to that effect to the Agent's nominee. The party incurring an Expense shall endeavor to promptly provide upon request of the Agent's nominee the appropriate documentary evidence supporting such Expense. Upon failure by the said party to provide the appropriate documentary evidence, the inquiring party shall have the right to send a written notice of dispute to the other party and the parties shall resolve such dispute\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nin the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof. Upon determination by such Independent Accountant (as defined below) that the Expense was not an Approved Expense, such Expense shall be deducted from the Program Expenses and the Agent and Monsanto shall include an appropriate adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(c). Allocated Expenses shall be paid no more than three weeks after months' end in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(c).\n\n(c) Allocation Rules. In the performance of their obligations under this Agreement, each party shall incur Allocated Expenses directly related to the Roundup L&G Business. Each allocated Approved Expense, regardless of the party incurring it, shall be reimbursed provided such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the Allocation Rules set forth for each category of cost and service per country or region, as the case may be, in Schedule 3.3(c) attached hereto (\"Allocated Expense\").\n\nSection 3.4 Resolution of Disputes Arising under Article 3. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, each party shall have the right, within twenty (20) days of receipt of the quarterly or annual financial statements to send a written notice of dispute to the other party. Upon receipt of such notices of dispute, the parties shall undertake the following steps:\n\n(a) First, for a period of fifteen (15) days, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for the purposes of attempting to mutually agree upon the item in dispute;\n\n(b) Second, if parties are unable to mutually agree upon the item in dispute, then within seven (7) business days following the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period, the parties shall agree in writing upon the selection of a nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the \"Independent Accountant\") to resolve the dispute. If the parties cannot agree upon such Independent Accountant within such time frame, then the Independent Accountant shall thereupon be selected by the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"), with preference being given by the AAA in making such selection to any one of the \"Big Four\" accounting firms (except for any firm which performs accounting services for either party) willing to perform the services required hereunder. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to act within thirty (30) days to resolve the dispute, and its decisions with respect to the dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant with respect to the settlement of the dispute shall be borne equally by the parties.\n\nSection 3.5 Fixed Contribution to Expenses.\n\n(a) Amount and Purpose. Each Program Year the Agent shall make a fixed contribution to the overall Expenses of the Roundup L&G Business in an amount equal to eighteen million U.S. Dollars ($18,000,000) (\"Contribution Payment\"). Such Contribution Payment shall be payable by the Agent to Monsanto in twelve equal monthly installments which shall be due on the first day of each month and shall not be subject to any \"set-off\".\n\nSection 3.6 Commission.\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Amount of Commission. In consideration to the Agent for performance of its duties and obligations hereunder, the Agent shall be entitled to a Commission (\"Commission\"). Such Commission shall represent a percentage of the Program EBIT realized by the Roundup L&G Business which percentage shall be (i) for Program Years 2017 and 2018, 50% of the Program EBIT and (ii) for Program Years 2019 and thereafter, 50% of the Program EBIT in excess of $40MM (such $40MM threshold, the \"Commission Threshold\"). The parties agree that the Commission Threshold may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties following the inclusion or exclusion of either new or existing countries in the Included Markets, including Activated Included Markets, or Excluded Markets, as applicable.\n\n(b) Payment of Commission. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall determine whether a Commission becomes payable, i.e., whether the cumulative Program EBIT for the Program Year up to the preceding month equals an amount in excess of the First Commission Threshold. If so, the Agent, on behalf of Monsanto shall by check or wire transfer, to the Agent's designated account for the payment of the applicable Commission pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 3.6(a) subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6(c).\n\n(c) Final Determination. Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each Program Year, the Agent shall deliver to Monsanto a Commission Statement which shall contain the final determination of the Commission due at the expiry of the Program Year and shall set forth any eventual adjustments, to the amounts paid up to the Agent under Section 3.6(b) during the preceding Program Year. If within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of such Commission Statement by the Agent, Monsanto does not provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the amount of the Commission for such Program Year shall be as provided thereon. If within such fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Commission Statement by Monsanto, Monsanto does provide the Agent written notice of objection to the Commission Statement, the parties shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 3.4 hereof.\n\nSection 3.7 [Intentionally deleted]\n\nSection 3.8 Additional Commission.\n\n(a) The parties acknowledge that Monsanto currently sells Glyphosate-based products under the Roundup trademark, directly or indirectly, to professional, industrial and agricultural users (\"Roundup Ag Products\"). Monsanto acknowledges that one of such Roundup Ag Products, the 2.5 gallon SKU containing 41% concentration of Glyphosate with the Brand name Roundup Pro (the \"Roundup Pro SKU\"), is currently being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States and may be purchased by consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market. Monsanto also acknowledges its obligations pursuant to Section 6.13(b) hereof.\n\n(b) The Agent is exclusively distributing and managing the sale of the Roundup Pro SKU in Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States. The parties acknowledge that the Agent purchases the Roundup Pro SKU from Monsanto (or a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) for the Agent's own account in its capacity as a distributor and not as a marketing agent, and the sales resulting from such Roundup\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nPro SKU shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenues hereunder. In the event that the Agent is terminated as an exclusive distributor of the Roundup Pro SKU by Monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU), any subsequent sales of the Roundup Pro SKU by parties other than Agent in the Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States will be subject to the provisions of Section 3.8(c) below.\n\n(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets. In the event that in the normal course of business the Agent determines based on satisfactory evidence that a material amount of additional Roundup Ag Products, above Program Year 2016 sales levels (such amount, the \"Historical Threshold\"), are being sold directly by Monsanto (or directly by any successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) through Lawn and Garden Channels in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to include, subject to the principles set forth in Section 3.8(d), an appropriate percentage of such incremental sales that exceed the Historical Threshold to reflect such Lawn and Garden Use within the definition of Program Sales Revenues so that the Agent receives credit therefor for purposes of calculating the Agent's Commission, or such other compensation as required to fully compensate the Agent for lost Commission as a result of such sales of Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold as the Parties may agree (collectively, the \"Additional Amount\").\n\n(d) In implementing the foregoing, the parties shall follow the following principles: (i) that Monsanto's sales of Roundup Ag Products are not intended for Lawn and Garden Use and that Monsanto shall not sell Roundup Ag Products directly or promote the indirect sale thereof, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets and (ii) that there shall be no transfer of historical or future sales of Roundup Ag Products in the Ag Market into Program Sales Revenues. Furthermore, the parties acknowledge that Roundup Ag Products having a formulation consisting of 41% or more Glyphosate and in container sizes over 2.5 gallons in the United States or over one liter in the other Included Markets shall be presumed to have no Lawn and Garden Use and therefor that sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall not be deemed to compete with Roundup Products in a manner that would justify adjustment of the calculation of Program Sales Revenues; provided that if the Agent is able to demonstrate to the Steering Committee that a material change in the amount of such Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold are being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith pursuant to Section 3.8(c) to adjust the calculation of Program Sales Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Agent, any of its Affiliates and/or Seamless Control LLC (\"Seamless Control\"), but only if Seamless Control is then controlled by Agent or an Affiliate of Agent, sells, directly or indirectly, Roundup Ag Products through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets above the Historical Threshold, sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall (i) to the extent in excess of the Historical Threshold, be added to the Historical Threshold and (ii) not be considered by Monsanto or the Agent when determining the Additional Amount.\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) During the 2014 Program Year and for each Program Year thereafter, in consideration for the Agent's marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup 365, for the 2014 Program Year, and for each Program Year thereafter, if 365 Gross Profits exceed USD $10MM in a Program Year, the Agent shall be paid an amount equal to 7% of the 365 Gross Profits for such Program Year (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the first USD $10MM of the 365 Gross Profits). The amount that becomes payable under this Section 3.8(e) with respect to a Program Year shall be included as a separate line item in the Commission Statements delivered by Agent to Monsanto and the payment of such amount shall be in addition to the Commission otherwise payable under Section 3.6(b) and shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 3.8(e).\n\nARTICLE 4 - ROUNDUP L&G BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE\n\nSection 4.1 Underlying principles for the Roundup L&G Business Management Structure.\n\n(a) The Roundup L&G Business management structure, as described in this Article, has been created for the purposes of fostering and promoting the following interests of the parties:\n\n(i) Common Interests:\n\n(A) achieve the maximum volume and profit levels for the Roundup Business;\n\n(B) continue to strengthen the Roundup brand; and\n\n(C) leverage the strengths of both parties while working together in a constructive and harmonious way.\n\n(ii) Monsanto's Interests:\n\n(A) retain ability to resume full management of the Roundup Business upon termination of this Agreement;\n\n(B) retain control over key business decisions; and\n\n(C) provide global stewardship of the Roundup brand.\n\n(iii) The Agent's Interests:\n\n(A) manage the Roundup Business within the parameters of approved Annual Business Plans.\n\n(b) The parties understand that such structure may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties provided any such change shall take into account the respective interests of each party as described hereunder.\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Steering Committee.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto and the Agent shall each appoint by April 1 of each year two (2) executives to a steering committee (\"Steering Committee\") provided, however, any vacancy shall be filled in such a manner that the parties shall maintain their respective proportionate representation on the Steering Committee and that upon failure by either party to appoint said two (2) executives by such time, the two (2) executives previously appointed by such party shall be deemed appointed for another Program Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of the Steering Committee for the Program Year 2017 shall be the individuals whose names are set forth as Schedule 4.2(a) attached hereto. Either party may also invite a reasonable number of additional members from their respective organizations to attend meetings of the Steering Committee as they deem appropriate; provided, that, except to the extent provided under this Agreement, such additional members in attendance shall not have any voting rights.\n\n(b) Meetings, Quorum and Voting Requirements.\n\n(1) Meetings. The Steering Committee shall meet at least once a year for purposes of approving the Annual Business Plan no later than September 15 of every calendar year. Any member of the Steering Committee shall have the right to call a special meeting of the Steering Committee provided a prior written notice of at least fifteen (15) days shall be given to each member together with an agenda for such meeting.\n\n(2) Quorum and Voting Requirements. The quorum for any meeting of the Steering Committee shall require the participation of all four (4) members except that any member shall be deemed present when participating via phone or video conference. Any decisions by the Steering Committee may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of three of the members of the Steering Committee. In the event of a deadlock, when a particular vote is divided equally between the four members, the matter shall be submitted to Monsanto's senior executive responsible for the oversight of the Roundup L&G Business (as determined by Monsanto) (the \"Monsanto Senior Executive\"), who shall have the exclusive discretion to resolve the matter and such decision shall bind the Steering Committee to such action or inaction. Notwithstanding any future assignment of this Agreement to a third party by reason of a Roundup Sale, the Monsanto Senior Executive shall retain its right of veto in case of deadlock of the Steering Committee.\n\nFor every meeting of the Steering Committee, minutes shall be kept and circulated for approval to all four members. Every decision of the Monsanto Senior Executive shall also be recorded in writing and distributed to the members of the Steering Committee.\n\n(c) Authority. The Steering Committee shall:\n\n(i) approve all Annual Business Plans, and any Significant Deviations (as described in Section 4.3(b)) therefrom not previously approved jointly by the Business Units and the Global Support Team;\n\n(ii) approve any and all strategic plans;\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) review monthly reports submitted by the Business Units for the purposes of monitoring achievement and redirecting the Business Units by issuing a formal amendment to the Annual Business Plan then in effect;\n\n(iv) monitor and redirect, if need be, the performance of the Global Support Team;\n\n(v) approve any decisions relating to key personnel assigned to the Roundup Business within the Business Units, including Monsanto's and the Agent's employees;\n\n(vi) resolve any disagreement occurring between a Business Unit and the Global Support Team; and\n\n(vii) decide any other matter mutually agreed upon by Monsanto and the Agent.\n\nSection 4.3 Business Units.\n\n(a) Role and Reporting. The Roundup L&G Business shall be managed, on behalf of the Agent, by its respective pesticide business units for each of the Included Markets (\"Business Units\") provided that, for the management of the Roundup L&G Business, the head of each of the Business Units shall report directly to the Steering Committee.\n\n(b) Duties. The Business Units shall be responsible for:\n\n(i) taking any and all necessary actions to implement the approved Annual Business Plan and strategic plans, as may be amended from time to time, either by mutual agreement of the Business Unit and the Global Support Team or by the Steering Committee as described in Section 4.2(c);\n\n(ii) managing the day-to-day Roundup L&G Business;\n\n(iii) developing and submitting, in cooperation with the Global Support Team all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(iv) communicating, in writing or via meetings, on a regular basis, with the Global Support Team on all significant issues affecting the Roundup L&G Business; and\n\n(v) notifying the Global Support Team of any deviation to the Annual Business Plan, which, in their view, is reasonably likely to have a financial impact on the Program EBIT of at least $500,000 or constitutes a significant deviation from a non-financial item approved in the Annual Business Plan (\"Significant Deviation\").\n\nSection 4.4 Global Support Team.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto shall maintain a team of up to 10 employees, or such number as the Agent and Monsanto may agree to from time to time, to support the Roundup\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nL&G Business on a full-time basis as well as other employees who will support the Roundup L&G Business on a part-time basis (the \"Global Support Team\"). Monsanto may from time to time substitute any individual serving on the Global Support Team, with the written approval of the Agent, by providing a prior written notice to the Agent to such effect.\n\n(b) Duties. The Global Support Team shall be responsible to:\n\n(i) participate actively in the development of all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(ii) act as a liaison between any of Monsanto's functions or departments providing a support service to the Roundup Business (such as R&D, regulatory, etc.) and monitor the quality of services rendered;\n\n(iii) provide stewardship for the Roundup brand image worldwide;\n\n(iv) prepare internal assessments of the performance of the Roundup L&G Business for Monsanto management;\n\n(v) participate in planned key customer interactions and program presentations, either by participation in meetings or in preparatory sessions therefor;\n\n(vi) review and approve any material change or deviation in consumer communication, mass media, packaging design or any other marketing tactic that directly impacts the consumer perception and interface with the brand which may occur from time to time; and\n\n(vii) review and approve any Significant Deviation from the Annual Business Plan; and upon failure to agree with the Business Unit, prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee for resolution, provided that the Business Unit may similarly prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee.\n\nARTICLE 5 - DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF MONSANTO\n\nSection 5.1 Monsanto's Obligations and Rights. Subject to Article 3, unless and until expressly directed otherwise by the Business Units, with the prior written approval of the Steering Committee Monsanto shall continue to support the Roundup L&G Business by performing necessary services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times during the term of this Agreement, Monsanto shall be solely responsible for the following functions:\n\n(a) Research and Development. Monsanto shall (i) in its sole discretion, continue to develop new Glyphosate- based non-selective herbicide formulations and (ii) exercise commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith with the Agent to develop other non-selective herbicide formulations, in each case, as more particularly as described in Section 6.10 hereof;\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Regulatory Compliance.

Subject to the provisions of any existing intercreditor agreement to which Monsanto is currently a party (as the same may be amended, modified or terminated) and except as may otherwise be agreed to by Monsanto, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld in the case of similar arrangements with existing or future institutional lenders, the Agent agrees not to allow any liens or encumbrances of any nature to attach to Roundup Products.

The Agent shall cooperate with Monsanto, and promptly take such actions as requested by Monsanto, with respect to any defective product including any \"stop-sales\" or recalls for Roundup Products.\n\nSection 6.10 New Roundup Products.\n\n(a) During the term of this Agreement, Monsanto covenants and agrees to first offer (the \"Product Offer\") to the Agent, with respect to the Included Markets, the exclusive agency and distribution rights to any newly created non-selective herbicide product, which is not marketed for Lawn and Garden Use as of the date of this Agreement, and which Monsanto, in its exclusive, reasonable discretion, determines to be suitable for sale as a new product for Lawn and Garden Use (the \"New Product\"); provided, however, that for the Lawn and Garden Market, that any new product containing Glyphosate or another non- selective herbicide shall be considered to be a New Product. The Product Offer shall be in writing, shall be in sufficient detail describing such New Product, and shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date of commercialization of such New Product for uses other than Lawn and Garden Use. In no event shall Monsanto, directly or indirectly, commercialize any New Product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets without first offering such New Product to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10. If the Agent agrees in writing\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nwithin ninety (90) days of receipt of the Product Offer to accept the New Product, then such New Product shall be, without further action or amendment, included within the definition of Roundup Products and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such event, the parties shall adjust the Commission Thresholds to reflect this additional source of revenue unless the New Product is a Glyphosate-based product or an improvement of any existing Roundup Products in which case the Commission Thresholds shall remain the same. If the Agent fails to agree in writing to accept the Product Offer within such ninety (90) days of receipt, then Monsanto shall have the exclusive right to manufacture, package, promote, distribute, and sell such New Product in the Included Markets, regardless of any actual or potential conflict with the terms of Agreement.\n\n(b) During the term of this Agreement, the Agent may, from time to time, propose that Monsanto utilize a different formulation of non-selective herbicide product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets that may or may not contain Glyphosate (an \"Agent Proposed Product\") and offer the Agent the exclusive agency and distribution rights to such Agent Proposed Product under this Agreement. Any Agent Proposed Product proposal shall contain supporting detail describing the Agent Proposed Product. The Agent shall supply Monsanto with any information Monsanto reasonably requests as part of its evaluation. Monsanto shall not unreasonably delay its evaluation of an Agent Proposed Product following receipt of any such information. Monsanto shall give good faith consideration to all Agent Proposed Products, and provided that Monsanto shall have the sole discretion in branding any Agent Proposed Product, Monsanto shall not unreasonably refuse to submit to the Agent a Product Offer for an Agent Proposed Product under Section 6.10(a) that is, in Monsanto's reasonable discretion, commercially attractive, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other material aspects, including, without limitation, any possible effect of such Agent Proposed Product on Monsanto's overall business and business prospects.\n\n(c) The Agent hereby grants Monsanto an exclusive (even with respect to the Agent and its Affiliates), non- transferrable, royalty-free license and right to use the trademarks EcoSense and Path Clear (Trademark Application No. 1430287) in Canada (such trademarks, the \"Canada Marks\"), only in connection with Natural Products (as defined below) in the natural non-selective weedkiller category for Lawn & Garden Use during the term of this Agreement. Monsanto agrees to use the Canada Marks in a manner consistent with the form and style of such trademarks as used by the Agent, or as otherwise agreed in writing with the Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent currently uses and/or may in the future use the Canada Marks on products in categories other than non-selective weedkillers for Lawn & Garden Use, and the license granted to Monsanto herein shall not affect or restrict the Agent's rights in such other categories. Such license shall terminate automatically upon any expiration or termination of the term of this Agreement applicable to Canada. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be interpreted as granting Monsanto a license to the Canada Marks outside of Canada or outside the category specified in this Section 6.10(c). The Agent represents and warrants that it is a licensee with the right to sublicense the Canada Marks, and that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks, as described herein, shall not infringe upon the rights of any third party. The Agent agrees to hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Monsanto from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from a breach of this warranty by the Agent. The Agent agrees to carry out at its expense, all procedures necessary to register and maintain the Canada\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks in full force and effect and Monsanto agrees to cooperate with the Agent in providing any product sample or other required information to assist in the maintenance and renewal of the Canada Marks. Monsanto acknowledges OMS Investments, Inc.'s exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the Canada Marks and agrees that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks shall inure to the benefit of OMS Investments, Inc. Monsanto further agrees that it will in no way dispute, impugn or attack the validity of said Canada Marks or OMS Investments, Inc.'s or the Agent's rights thereto.\n\n(d) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto exclusive access to the registrations for an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation in Canada. The parties will agree on the mutually acceptable details and mechanics of access and appropriate registration/labeling rights, the cost of which will be included in the Roundup P&L. Access to the then-current registrations shall continue in perpetuity, on a nonexclusive basis, following any future termination or expiration of this Agreement, enabling Monsanto or its successors to market and sell such formulations following such termination under trademarks that are different from the trademarks licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c).\n\n(e) Together, the respective trademark licenses and registration access provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 result in the following product: an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation under the EcoSense brand in Canada and an acetic acid nonselective weed killer formulation under the Path Clear brand in Canada (collectively, the \"Natural Products\"). Any Natural Product marketed and/or sold under a different brand name in Canada shall be deemed to be a Natural Product and subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Natural Products will be included in the Roundup P&L and shall be subject to the same terms, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement as are the Roundup Products, except as modified by this Section 6.10. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any improvements to the existing Natural Products formulations in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto access to such improvements and the improved products will be included in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current formulations of the Natural Products. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any new natural nonselective weedkiller products (including, without limitation, any herbicidally active substances which are plant extracts, including those derived from oleic acid or which are derived from plant extracts by processing including active substances) in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto a right of first refusal to include such new products in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current Natural Products, and if accepted, such new products will become Natural Products. In the event that the Agent offers in writing a product to Monsanto pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10(e) and Monsanto does not accept such product in writing within 90 days of the Agent's offer, the Agent may market such product at its own discretion utilizing an alternative trademark from those licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c) (which alternative trademark is not identical or materially similar to the Canada Trademarks.\n\n(f) The marketing, sale and distribution of each of the Natural Products in Canada shall be governed in all respects by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the calculation of the Commission pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof. Following the inclusion of the Natural Products in the Roundup L&G Business in Canada, and fully consistent\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the performance standards and requirements of Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement, the performance of the Roundup L&G Business will be evaluated based on the total results of the business, including from current Roundup Products, the added Natural Products, and any future products added to the Roundup L&G Business. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Annual Business Plan, the Agent shall continue to promote Roundup Products in the manner described in Section 2.2(a)(7). The parties will ensure that marketing, promotional and selling plans promote the sale of the Natural Products in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement and complementary to Roundup Products, and does not directly or indirectly disparage or advertise against Roundup Products, as set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, in addition to marketing and selling the Natural Products in such a manner to existing Customers, the Agent will use its best efforts to target retailers and customers who do not currently purchase Roundup Products. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent hereby agrees that matters relating to the Naturals Products shall be included in the Annual Business Plan.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the letter agreement dated February 26, 2010 between the Agent and Monsanto shall survive in full force and effect in its entirety.\n\n(h) No provision of this Section 6.10 should be understood, explicitly or implicitly, as an amendment of the noncompetition provisions of this Agreement, or a relinquishment by either party of their rights or waiver of their obligations except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.10.\n\nSection 6.11 Additional Roundup Products.\n\n(a) Each product listed in Schedule 6.11(a) (an \"Additional Roundup Product\") shall be included in the definition of \"Roundup Products\" for the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that, such Additional Roundup Products shall only be considered \"Roundup Products\" with respect to those countries set forth in the column titled \"Included Markets\" opposite such Additional Roundup Product in Schedule 6.11(a).\n\n(b) For purposes hereof, \"Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data\" shall mean the formula for the Additional Roundup Products, the raw material specifications, analytical methods, and other information as provided in the Quality Assurance Manual (as defined in the Formulation Agreement), the instructions and know how associated with formulating the Additional Roundup Products and any and all data related to the Additional Roundup Products required to make, sell, offer for sale, register with federal, state, or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law), and support and defend marketing claims for, the Additional Roundup Products in the United States and its territories.

Monsanto and the Agent stipulate and agree that the injury which will be caused to the Agent by the termination of this Agreement under the circumstances which shall give rise to the payment of the Termination Fee are difficult or impossible of accurate estimation; that by establishing the Termination Fee they intend to provide for the payment of damages and not a penalty; and that the sum stipulated for the Termination Fee is a reasonable pre-estimate of the probable loss which will be suffered by the Agent in the event of such termination.\n\nThe Termination Fee payable shall vary in accordance with the Table hereunder:\n\nProgram Year Termination Fee\n\n2015  P rog ram Yea r  and thereafter The greater of (i) $175MM or (ii) four (4) times an amount equal to (A) the average of the Program EBIT for the three (3) trailing Program Years prior to the year of termination, minus (B) the 2015 Program EBIT (excluding Europe and Australia) of $186.4MM.\n\nFor example, if the Roundup Sale occurs in 2033 (all expressed in $MM):\n\n2015  2030 2031 2032 3 year Avg Termination Fee $186.4 $310 $309 $314 $311 $498.4\n\n(e) Remedies for Monsanto.

In the event either party claims that a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct has been committed by the other party (the \"Breaching Party\"), or this Agreement otherwise explicitly provides that the provisions of this Section 10.4(g) apply, the following procedures shall apply:\n\n(1) After the asserted occurrence of a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, the party who contends that such breach, fraud or misconduct has occurred (the \"Claimant\") shall send to the Breaching Party a notice, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Claimant shall: (i) identify the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct which it contends has occurred; (ii) appoint an arbitrator; and (iii) demand that the Breaching Party appoint an arbitrator.\n\n(2) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, the Breaching Party shall send a response to the Claimant, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Breaching Party shall: (i) indicate whether it contests the asserted occurrence of the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be; and (ii) if it does contest such asserted occurrence, appoint a second arbitrator. The failure on the part of the Breaching Party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the arbitrator designated by the Claimant as the 'sole arbitrator.\n\n(3) If the Breaching Party appoints an arbitrator, then within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Breaching Party's response by the Claimant, the two arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. Upon their selection by either means, the three arbitrators (the \"Arbitrators\") shall expeditiously proceed to determine whether a Material Breach, Material Default or Material Willful Misconduct has occurred, in accordance with the procedures hereafter set forth.\n\n(4) Except as specifically modified herein, the arbitration proceeding contemplated by this section (the \"Arbitration\") shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The cost of the Arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with the understanding that the Arbitrators may reimburse the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Arbitrators for that party's cost of the Arbitration in connection with the award made by the Arbitrators as described below.\n\n(5) The award shall be made within three (3) months after the appointment of the third Arbitrator, and each of the Arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the Arbitrators, if necessary.\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n(6) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by the notice or the response, including those documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the Arbitrators, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 60 days following the appointment of the third Arbitrator.\n\n(7) At the request of a party, the Arbitrators shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the Arbitrators deem such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be held within 30 days of the making of a request, and shall be limited to a maximum of number of hours' duration as may be mutually agreed to by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement as may be determined by the Arbitrators. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.\n\n(8) Either party may apply to the Arbitrators seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy).\n\n(9) The scope of the Arbitration shall include the following:\n\n(i) a determination as to whether the act(s) or omission(s) set forth by the Claimant have occurred;\n\n(ii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be;\n\n(iii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(iv) a determination as to the amount of monetary damages, if any, suffered by the Claimant, as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, regardless of whether such act(s) or omission(s) rise to the level of Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(v) a determination, to the extent applicable, of the specific performance which could and should be decreed to correct any breach, fraud or material misconduct which the Arbitrators determine can be cured by the issuance of such decree;\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) a determination as to which party, if any, is the prevailing party in the Arbitration, and the amount of such party's costs and fees. \"Costs and fees\" means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys' fees; and\n\n(vii) a determination as to such matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to carry out their duties in connection with the Arbitration.\n\n(10) The Arbitrators' award shall be in writing, shall be signed by a majority of the Arbitrators, and shall include a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim.\n\n(11) The Arbitrators' award shall, as applicable, include the following:\n\n(i) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the Claimant has suffered monetary damages as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, a monetary award in the amount of those damages;\n\n(ii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the harm resulting from those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred can be cured, in whole or in part by a decree of specific performance, such a decree of specific performance implementing such determination as can be submitted to and made the order of a Court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(iii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be, an award authorizing the Claimant to immediately terminate this Agreement, together with damages or specific performance, if determined by the Arbitrators to be appropriate;\n\n(iv) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that there is a prevailing party, and that said prevailing party should receive an award of its Costs and Fees, such award to the prevailing party; and\n\n(v) such other matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to implement their determinations made in the Arbitration.\n\n(12) The written determination of the Arbitrators shall be made and delivered promptly to the parties to the Arbitration and shall be final and conclusive upon the parties to the Arbitration.\n\n(13) Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any Arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 10.5 Termination by the Agent.\n\n(a) Material Breach, Material Fraud and Material Willful Misconduct.

Upon termination of this Agreement by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.5(a), Monsanto shall pay to the Agent the Termination Fee applicable pursuant to the Table set forth in Section 10.4(d).\n\n(d) Brand Decline Event.\n\n(i) If prior to Program Year 2023\n\n(A) the Sell-Through Business has declined by more than twenty-five percent (25%) as compared to the Sell-Through Business for Program Year 2014 due to legal, regulatory, governmental or non-governmental organization actions adversely affecting the market for Roundup Products or due to diminished consumer or retailer acceptance of Roundup Products due to anti-Monsanto or anti-glyphosate sentiment, or\n\n(B) there has been a significant decline in the overall health and goodwill of the Roundup brand, as measured by industry standard market research and best practices such as attitude and usage studies (provided that the decline is not primarily due to the acts or omissions of the Agent or its Affiliates), and, in the case of (A) or (B),\n\n(C) such declines cannot be remedied by the end of the next full Program Year,\n\nthen the Agent may provide notice to Monsanto of such alleged declines (such declines, a \"Brand Decline Event\").\n\n(ii) If Monsanto does not contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\narbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then that Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(ii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n(iii) If Monsanto does contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then the question of whether a Brand Decline Event has occurred will be finally determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement, and if a Brand Decline Event is finally determined to have occurred, then the Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(iii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) The amounts of the \"Additional Commission Amount\" mean, depending on the Program Year in which the Brand Decline Event occurs, the amounts indicated in the table below for the Program Years indicated:\n\nYear of Brand Decline Event => Program Year 2018 Program Year 2019 Program Year 2020 Program Year 2021 Program Year 2022\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2018 $10MM\n\n     Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2019 $10MM $10MM\n\n    Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2020 $10MM $10MM $10MM\n\n   Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2021 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM\n\n  Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2022 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2023 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2024 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2025\n\n\n\n$8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2026\n\n\n\n$6MM\n\nSection 10.6 Roundup Sale.\n\n(a) Roundup Sale Procedures.\n\n(i) Right of First Offer. If Monsanto (A) receives an unsolicited proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale and responds in any manner, other than rejecting such proposal, (B) solicits or makes a formal determination to solicit or make any proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale or (C) enters into an agreement relating to the provision of information with respect to a potential Roundup Sale (each a \"Roundup Sale Notice Trigger\"), the Agent shall have the rights as set forth in this Section 10.6 with respect to any such Roundup Sale and Monsanto shall promptly provide written notice to the Agent of such Roundup Sale as set forth\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\nin Section 10.6(a)(ii) (a \"Roundup Sale Notice\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 10.6(a) shall apply to any and all potential Roundup Sales.\n\n(ii) Roundup Sale Notice. Upon the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, Monsanto shall promptly provide a Roundup Sale Notice to the Agent along with all Roundup Offering Materials (subject to Monsanto entering into a confidentiality agreement on commercially reasonable terms with the Agent with respect to such Roundup Offering Materials). After the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, if Monsanto delivers any Roundup Offering Materials to a third party that contain material deviations from the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent, Monsanto shall provide copies of such Roundup Offering Materials to the Agent promptly after such delivery.\n\n(iii) Exclusivity.\n\n(A) For a period of sixty (60) days from the last date of receipt by the Agent of the Roundup Sale Notice and any related Roundup Offering Materials as set forth in Section 10.6(a)(ii) (the \"Exclusive Roundup Sale Period\"), Monsanto agrees to negotiate in good faith with the Agent on an exclusive basis with respect to any potential Roundup Sale. If and only if Monsanto has complied with the provisions of the preceding sentence and no definitive agreement has been entered into with the Agent or one of its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale, then following the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, Monsanto may then make solicitations to, or otherwise negotiate with, a third party or parties with respect to a Roundup Sale and may provide the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent to any such third party or parties in connection with a process to pursue a Roundup Sale. In the event that Monsanto engages in a process in which it seeks bids or proposals from more than one third party in connection with a contemplated Roundup Sale, the Agent shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) day exclusive negotiation period following the receipt and review by Monsanto of all bids or proposals (the \"Roundup Quiet Period\"), provided that, in determining the value of the price terms of the Agent's bid, Monsanto shall not discount the Agent's bid as a result of the fact that the Termination Fee is an offset or credit against the total purchase price, and that, during the Roundup Quiet Period, the Agent shall have the right to revise its original bid but shall not have the right to review the terms of any other bids or proposals. Monsanto may consummate a Roundup Sale with any third party only if such Roundup Sale is made pursuant to the acceptance by Monsanto of a Roundup Superior Offer.\n\n(B) During the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, neither Monsanto nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly through its or their agents, employees or representatives or otherwise, solicit, or cause the solicitation of, or in any way encourage the making of, any offer, proposal or indication of interest involving a Roundup Sale or negotiate with, respond to any inquiry from (except for \"no comment\" or another statement agreed to by the Agent), cooperate with or furnish or cause or authorize to be furnished any information to, any third party or its agents, employees or representatives with respect thereto, or disclose to any third party that a Roundup Sale Notice has been provided to the Agent. Monsanto will immediately advise the Agent of any offer, proposal or indication of interest received by Monsanto or its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale during the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period.\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Credit of Termination Fee.
