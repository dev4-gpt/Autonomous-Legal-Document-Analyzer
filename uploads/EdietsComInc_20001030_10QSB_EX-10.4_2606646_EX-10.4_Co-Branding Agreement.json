THE DIET CENTER.\n\n         1.1 Women.com will name an area, in which eDiets content will be published (such area, the \"Diet Center\"). Links (presented as Diet Center logos) to the Diet Center will be located on three Women.com channels (the Fitness Channel www.women.com/fitness; the Health Channel www.women.com/health; and the Food Channel www.women.com/food) and two subchannels within such channels to be determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereto. The first page of the Diet Center (the \"Gateway Page\") will have the look and feel of the Women.com Sites as specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Diet Center shall be branded with an icon that includes the eDiets logo. There will be no Women.com or eDiets registration required to enter and use the Gateway Page of the Diet Center. Women.com and eDiets will mutually agree upon the content and logo of the Gateway Page, including the display, appearance and placement of the Diet Center's logo, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the specifications set forth on Exhibit A hereto, prior to the launch date of the Diet Center (the \"Launch Date\"). eDiets and Women.com shall work together in good faith in order to implement such design and development and the continued enhancement of the Diet Center.\n\n         1.2 Women.com shall store and maintain the Gateway Page on, and serve the Gateway Page from, server(s) located on Women.com's premises or the premises of Women.com's third party web host. eDiets shall store and maintain the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page, and serve the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page from, server(s) located on eDiets' premises or the premises of eDiets' third party web host. Effective one week from the\n\n                                       1\n\nLaunch Date, eDiets shall include a back button to the Women.com Site on all pages of the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. If at any time during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the \"Negative Effect\"), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may remove any such back buttons.\n\n         1.3 Except as set forth in Section 1.2  [Women], eDiets will have sole responsibility for providing and maintaining at its own expense the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. eDiets and Women.com will work together regarding the on-going design and maintenance of the Diet Center.\n\n         1.4 Each party shall bear its own expenses related to its responsibilities under this Section 1.\n\n2.       EDIETS OBLIGATIONS.\n\n         2.1 Content License. eDiets hereby grants to Women.com, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a non-exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce and display the editorial content and other data, branding and other identification provided by eDiets to Women.com in connection with this Agreement (the \"eDiets Content\") on the Women.com Sites: (i) for publication in the Diet Center and elsewhere throughout the Women.com Sites; (ii) for the promotion of eDiets and the Diet Center on the Women.com Sites and in collateral advertising materials; and (iii) for such other purposes as are consistent with or otherwise authorized under this Agreement.\n\n         2.2 Delivery of Content. eDiets agrees to deliver to Women.com, by no later than fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, in a format specified by Women.com, the initial eDiets Content required by this Agreement, including any photos, text, data, illustrations, graphical elements, animation or banner ads. All eDiets Content delivered under this Agreement shall be consistent with the specifications for such eDiets Content (including specifications as to manner and media), and otherwise in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement,\n\nSource: EDIETS COM INC, 10QSB, 10/30/2000\n\n\n\n\n\nincluding Exhibit D hereto, and any production schedules developed by the parties from time to time. eDiets agrees that it will respond in a timely manner to be agreed upon by the parties to all reasonable requests made by Women.com or its agents for updated eDiets Content and refreshing of eDiets Content for the Women.com Sites.\n\n         2.3 Format. eDiets will deliver the eDiets Content in such \"camera-ready\" or digital format, as agreed to by the parties.\n\n         2.4 Editorial Guidelines. eDiets shall ensure that the eDiets Content complies with Women.com's editorial guidelines.

In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits. Women.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to require eDiets to eliminate, any banner, hypertext or other link from the Women.com Site to any web site containing content promoting or advertising tobacco, liquor, controlled substances, gambling, firearms or sexually explicit, offensive or degrading material. In addition to the foregoing and the content guidelines set forth in Section 5.2  [EXCLUSIVITY] hereof, eDiets may not directly link from the Gateway Page to any Women.com Competitive Company (as defined in Section 5.2  [EXCLUSIVITY]).\n\n         2.5 Facts. eDiets shall be solely responsible for ensuring the timeliness, accuracy, and correctness of all facts, data and information (\"Facts\") contained within the eDiet Content. eDiets shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Women.com, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against all damages, awards, costs, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and expenses that such parties may incur as a result of third party claims arising from such third parties' reliance on Facts. Women.com retains the right, but not the obligation, to independently corroborate, or have corroborated, the timeliness, accuracy, and correctness of all Facts.\n\n3.       ADVERTISING.\n\n         3.1 Advertising and Promotion. Advertising and Promotion. Women.com shall make available to eDiets and eDiets shall purchase from Women.com advertising and promotional inventory in the amounts and at the rates specified in Exhibit B hereto and in accordance with the terms specified in Exhibit D hereto.
