Nothing in this provision shall limit          Corio's immediate duty to defend Changepoint against any such claims.          Changepoint shall cooperate with Corio, at Corio's expense, in          defending or settling any such claims and Changepoint may join in          defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.\n\n9        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n         EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTIONS 2.7, 8, 10 AND 12.3 OF THIS          AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR          RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE          EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CORIO HEREUNDER FOR THE          TRANSACTION WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES TO DURING THE TWELVE (12)          MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CAUSE OF\n\n                                       13\n\n         ACTION FIRST ARISING, EVEN IF IT IS A CONTINUOUS ONE, OR IN THE          AGGREGATE, WITH RESPECT OF ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO          THIS AGREEMENT, THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CORIO UNDER THIS          AGREEMENT TO CHANGEPOINT.

THE          PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION          OF RISK.\n\n10       CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n         Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential          Information received from the other party other than as expressly          permitted under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in effect          between the parties dated October 29, 1999, which is incorporated          herein by reference and made a part hereof.

Each          party covenants that during the term of this Agreement, it will          continue to require all of such employees, agents, contractors or          consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention Agreement.\n\n11       TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n11.1     TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date          and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, shall continue in          full force and effect for an initial period of five (5) years.

Customer hereby submits to the non-exclusive                       jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for                       any legal action arising out of this Agreement or the                       performance of the obligations hereunder or thereunder.                       This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in the State of                       New York, and Customer agrees not to commence any action,                       suit or proceeding against Changepoint or any affiliate of                       Changepoint or any of their employees, officers or                       directors in any jurisdiction other than the State of New                       York.\n\n                                       35\n\n9.10     DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION\n\n                 In the event that any dispute or disagreement between                       Customer and Changepoint with respect to the                       interpretation of any provision of this Agreement, the                       performance of Changepoint or Customer under this                       Agreement, or any other matter that is in dispute between                       the parties related to this Agreement, upon the written                       request of either party, the parties will meet for the                       purpose of resolving such dispute. The parties agree to                       discuss the problem and negotiate in good faith without                       the necessity of any formal proceedings related thereto.                       No formal proceedings for the resolution of such dispute                       may be commenced until either party concludes in good                       faith that the applicable resolution through continued                       negotiation of the matter in issue does not appear likely.                       The parties further agree that all disputes hereunder                       which cannot be settled in the manner hereinbefore                       described (any such dispute is referred to here as a                       \"Dispute\") will be settled by final and binding                       arbitration conducted in accordance with the American                       Arbitration Association (or any successor thereto), as                       amended from time to time. Judgment upon the award                       rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any                       court having jurisdiction thereof, or application may be                       made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award                       and an enforcement, as the law of such jurisdiction may                       require or allow.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes with respect to any Infringement Claim including without limitation any claim based on the infringement, violation or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right shall not be settled by arbitration, without the prior written consent of the parties.\n\n                      The arbitration panel will be composed of one person                       appointed by the party requesting the arbitration (the                       \"Applicant\"), one person appointed by the other party (the                       \"Respondent\") and a third person to act as chairperson,                       chosen by the two arbitrators, or, if both parties agree,                       the arbitration panel will consist of a sole arbitrator.                       No person may be appointed as an arbitrator unless he or                       she is independent of the Applicant and Respondent, is                       skilled in the subject matter of the Dispute and is not                       directly or indirectly carrying on or involved in a                       business being carried on in competition with the business                       of the parties. The decision of the arbitration panel                       shall be made by a majority vote or by the sole                       arbitrator, as the case may be. In the event of the                       failure of the arbitration panel to reach a majority                       decision, the decision of the chairperson shall constitute                       the decision of the arbitration panel. The venue for the                       arbitration shall be at the City of New York, New York                       unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.\n\n                                       36\n\n                             CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT\n\nCorio/Changepoint Rev. 12/13/99\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential/Draft\n\n                                   APPENDIX A\n\nThe Components which are the subject of the License, the Software Licenses granted to Customer and the fees payable to Changepoint hereunder are as follows:\n\n1.
