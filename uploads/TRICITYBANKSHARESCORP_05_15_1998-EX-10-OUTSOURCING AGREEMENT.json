The time prescribed by Customer for each banking day for which on-line computing facilities shall be made available for each product or service is set forth below.  \"Availability\" for purposes of this paragraph shall be expressed as a percentage for each calendar month and shall be the number 100 less the ratio of (i) time period of unscheduled outages over (ii) total time prescribed less the time period of scheduled outages.\n\n                    Service Availability      ATM1 Monday-Thursday     12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight  Friday              12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight  Saturday       12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight  Sunday         12:01 a.m.     -      2:00 a.m.                   6:00 a.m.        12:00 midnight\n\nCardbase Management System Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nCIS & Deposit System Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nLoan System Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nGeneral Ledger Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nInformation Desktop Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nTeller System Monday - Thursday   6:45 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              6:45 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       6:45 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         6:45 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nIRS Government Reporting System Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nAccount Analysis Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nSafe Box Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday - Sunday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nVRU 1 Monday - Thursday   12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Friday              12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Saturday       12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Sunday         12:01 a.m.     -       2:00 a.m.                   6:00 a.m.        12:00 midnight\n\nBank Control Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Friday              7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight Sunday         7:00 a.m. -    12:00 midnight\n\nAccount Reconciliation Monday - Thursday   7:00 a.m. -    6:45 p.m. Friday              7:00 a.m. -    9:30 p.m. Saturday       7:00 a.m. -    4:30 p.m.\n\nDeposit Teller1 Monday - Thursday   12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Friday              12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Saturday       12:01 a.m.     -    12:00 midnight Sunday         12:01 a.m.     -      2:00 a.m.                   6:00 a.m.        12:00 midnight\n\n_____________________\n\n     1    M&I's objective is to provide 24 x 7 hour availability for these systems.  M&I does however need to perform regular technical maintenance (e.g., NCP maintenance), CPU IPLs, DASD installs, IHS gens, etc.).  This type of maintenance is performed between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. CST/CDT.  These activities may result in system downtime during this window.\n\n          C.   Processing Time.  M&I will process transactions in an average of 2.5 seconds for teller transactions (not to exceed six (6) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month)  and in an average of three point five (3.5) seconds (not to exceed seven (7) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month) for bank operations CRT transactions as measured over a calendar month, from the time the transaction is sent by the Customer's controller or gateway to the time the processed data is returned to the Customer's controller or gateway.  Should M&I not be able to perform in accordance with the Performance Standards because Customer failed to acquire network or equipment recommended by M&I, or such additional network or equipment as may be reasonably necessary based on the circumstances, M&I shall notify Customer in writing and Customer shall either acquire such network and/or equipment or accept the response time that is achieved.\n\n          D.   Service Level Credits.  REDACTED\n\n10.  MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICES\n\n     10.1 Modifications to Services.  M&I may modify, amend, enhance, update, or provide an appropriate replacement for the software used to provide the Services, or any element of its systems at any time to: (i) improve the Services or (ii) facilitate the continued economic provision of the Services to Customer or M&I, provided that the functionality of the Services is not materially adversely affected.\n\n     10.2 Partial Termination by M&I.  M&I may, at any time, withdraw any of the Services (other than the Core Services) upon providing ninety (90) days' prior written notice to Customer.  M&I may also terminate any of the Services immediately upon any final regulatory, legislative, or judicial\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermination that providing such Services is inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or upon imposition by any such authority of restrictions or conditions which would detract from the economic or other benefits to M&I or Customer to any element of the Services.  In the event a Service provided as part of the monthly Base Fee is terminated by M&I, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an appropriate reduction in the monthly Base Fee.\n\n     10.3 Partial Termination by Customer.\n\n          A.   Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Monthly Base Fee pricing offered to Customer by M&I is based on certain services provided by M&I's Integrated Banking System.  Customer agrees that, during the Term, Customer shall be required to obtain from M&I all of those Services which are included in the Monthly Base Fee, as set forth on Schedule 6.2.\n\nREDACTED\n\n     10.4 Development of Custom Software.  M&I reserves the right to determine the programming (whether hardware or software) utilized by M&I with the equipment used in fulfilling its duties under this Agreement.  All programs (including ideas and know-how and concepts) developed by M&I are and shall remain M&I's sole property.  Any writing or work of authorship created by M&I in the course of performing the Services under this Agreement, even if paid for by Customer, shall be the property of M&I (\"Developed Software\").  M&I may make such Developed Software available to any of its other customers; provided, however, if Customer has paid for such Developed Software and M&I offers, as part of M&I's standard price list, a separate service resulting exclusively from such Developed Software, M&I will refund, or credit, to Customer a portion of any amounts paid for such Developed Software on terms and conditions agreed to by the parties prior to commencement of work on the Developed Software.\n\n11.  TERMINATION\n\n     11.1 For Convenience.  Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (\"Termination for Convenience Fee\") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall apply to any early termination of this Agreement other than pursuant to an Event of Default on the part of Customer or M&I or pursuant to Section 11.3 below.  Fifty percent of the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days following the date of Customer's notice and the remaining 50% shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date of Termination.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, any unamortized Conversion or other costs, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Convenience Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.\n\n     11.2 For Cause.\n\n          A.   If M&I terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of Customer, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 above without complying with the notification requirements set forth in Section 11.1, then Customer shall pay M&I a termination fee (\"Termination for Cause Fee\") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value, payable as set forth in Section 11.1 above.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Cause Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.\n\n          B.   If Customer terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of M&I, Customer shall not be responsible for any termination fees or charges as a result thereof.\n\nREDACTED\n\n     11.4 Termination Assistance.  Commencing six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, or upon any termination of this Agreement for any reason, M&I shall provide Customer, at Customer's expense, all necessary assistance to allow the Services to continue without interruption or adverse affect to Customer and to facilitate the orderly transition of Services to Customer or its designee (\"Termination Assistance\").  At the written request of Customer, given at least 100 days prior to expiration of the Term of the Agreement, M&I shall continue to provide Customer all Services at the rates set forth in this Agreement, for a maximum period of six (6) months.  As part of the Termination Assistance, M&I shall assist Customer to develop a plan for the transition of all data processing services from M&I to Customer or its designee on a reasonable schedule developed by Customer.  Prior to providing any Termination Assistance, M&I shall deliver to Customer a good faith estimate of all such Expenses and charges including, without limitation, charges for custom programming services.  Customer understands and agrees that all Expenses and charges for Termination Assistance shall be computed in accordance with M&I's then-current rates for such products, materials and services.  Nothing contained herein shall obligate Customer to receive Termination Assistance from M&I.\n\n12.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES\n\n\n\n\n\n     12.1 By M&I.  It shall be an Event of Default on the part of M&I if: (i) M&I becomes insolvent, or a receiver of conservator shall be appointed with respect to M&I; or (ii) M&I shall fail to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement which have a material adverse effect on Customer, and such failure is not cured within 30 days after written notice from Customer; or (iii) M&I fails to meet any Performance Standard and such failure is not cured within ninety (90) days after written notice from Customer.\n\n     12.2 By Customer.  It shall be an Event of Default on the part of the Customer if: (i) Customer becomes insolvent, or a receiver of conservator shall be appointed with respect to the Customer; or (ii) Customer shall fail to pay any sum due M&I within the prescribed time period, and such failure continues for ten days after written notice thereof from M&I; or (iii) Customer shall fail to perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement which have a material adverse effect on M&I, and such failure is not cured within 30 days after written notice from M&I.\n\n     12.3 Remedies.  Following an Event of Default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to and commence the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 15 or to terminate this Agreement and collect its Damages.\n\n13.  DAMAGES\n\n     13.1 Direct Damages.  Customer and M&I shall be liable to the other only for direct damages arising out of or relating to their respective performance or non-performance of obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the following shall be considered direct damages for the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n          A.   Costs of recreating or reloading any of Customer's information that is lost or damaged;\n\n          B.   Costs of implementing a work-around in respect of a failure to provide the Services;\n\n          C.   Costs of replacing lost or damaged equipment, software, and materials;\n\n          D.   Costs and expenses incurred by Customer to correct errors in software maintenance and enhancements provided as part of the Services;\n\n          E.   Costs and expenses incurred by Customer to procure the Services from an alternate source, to the extent in excess of M&I's charges under this Agreement; and\n\n          F.   Straight time, overtime, or related expenses incurred by Customer, including overhead allocations of Customer for Customer's employees, wages and salaries of additional employees, travel expenses, overtime expenses, telecommunication charges, and similar charges, due to failure of M&I to provide the Services or incurred in connection with subsections (A) through (E) above, to the extent that such straight time, overtime, or related expenses exceed what Customer would have paid to M&I if M&I were providing the Services, and limited to the amount that M&I would have paid to Customer under subsection (E) above if Customer chose to procure the Services from an alternate source.\n\n     13.2 No Consequential Damages.  Neither Customer nor M&I shall be liable for, nor will the measure of any damages in any event include, any indirect, incidental, punitive, special or consequential damages or amounts for loss of income, profits or savings arising out of or relating to performance or non-performance under this Agreement.\n\n     13.3 Equitable Relief.  Either party may seek equitable remedies, including specific performance and injunctive relief, for a breach of the other party's obligations under this Agreement.\n\n     13.4 Limitation of Liability.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, M&I's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed payments made to M&I by Customer under this Agreement during the three (3) months prior to the event.  No lawsuit or other action may be brought by either party hereto, or on any claim or controversy based upon or arising in any way out of this Agreement be brought, after one (1) year from the date on which the cause of action arose; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the collection of any amounts due under this Agreement.\n\n     13.5 Liquidated Damages.  Customer acknowledges that M&I shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2(A) and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination.  Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\n\n14.  INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY\n\n     14.1 Insurance.\n\n          A.   Throughout the Term of this Agreement, M&I shall maintain at all times at its own cost and expense:\n\n               1.   Commercial General Liability Insurance covering its premises, including bodily injury, property damage, broad form contractual\n\n\n\n\n\nliability and independent contractors, with primary limits of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000).\n\n               2.

All Risk Property Insurance in an amount adequate to cover the cost of replacement of all equipment, improvements, and betterments at M&I locations in the event of loss or damage.\n\n          B.   All  policies of such insurance shall be written by a carrier or carriers rated \"A\" or above by Best, shall contain a clause requiring the carrier to give Customer at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any material change or cancellation of coverage for any reason, and simultaneously with M&I's execution of this Agreement, and annually thereafter, at Customer's request, M&I shall deliver to Customer original Certificates of Insurance evidencing the coverage required by this Section.\n\n     14.2 Indemnity.\n\n          A.   By Customer.  Customer shall indemnify M&I from, and defend M&I against, any liability or expenses arising out of or relating to (i) the inaccuracy  or untruthfulness of any representation or warranty made by Customer to M&I, (ii) a violation of Federal, state, or other laws or regulations for the protection of persons or members of a protected class or category of persons by Customer or its employees or agents, (iii) sexual discrimination or harassment by Customer or its employees or agents, (iv) work-related injury or death caused by Customer or its employees or agents, (v) tangible personal or real property damage or financial or monetary loss incurred by M&I resulting from Customer's acts or omissions, or those of its employees or agents and (vi) those matters included in Section 6.6(B) above.  Customer shall be responsible for any costs and Expenses incurred by M&I in connection with the enforcement of this Paragraph A.\n\n          B.   By M&I.  M&I shall indemnify Customer from, and defend Customer against, any liability or expenses arising out of or relating to (i) any claim by a third party that the Services or M&I's software infringe upon any United States patent, copyright or trademark of a third party, (ii) any claim by a third party in respect of services or systems provided by M&I to a third party, (iii) the inaccuracy or untruthfulness of any representation or warranty made by M&I to Customer, (iv) a violation of Federal, state, or other laws or regulations for the protection of persons or members of a protected class or category of persons by M&I or its employees or agents (v) sexual discrimination or harassment by M&I, its employees, or agents, (vi) work-related injury or death caused by M&I, its employees, or agents, and (vii) tangible personal or real property damage or financial or monetary loss incurred by Customer resulting from M&I's acts or omissions or those of its employees or agents.  M&I shall be responsible for any costs and Expenses incurred by Customer in connection with the enforcement of this Paragraph B.\n\n     14.3 Indemnification Procedures.  If any third party makes a claim covered by this Section against an indemnitee with respect to which such indemnitee intends to seek indemnification under this Section, such indemnitee shall give notice of such claim to the indemnifying party, including a brief description of the amount and basis therefor, if known.  Upon giving such notice, the indemnifying party shall be obligated to defend such indemnitee against such claim, and shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of the claim with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party, reasonably satisfactory to the indemnitee.  Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with, and assist, the indemnifying party in its defense against such claim in all reasonable respects.  The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnitee fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own separate counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnitee; provided, however (1) if the parties agree that it is advantageous to the defense for the indemnitee to employ its own counsel or (2) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnitee, based upon an opinion of counsel which shall be provided to the indemnifying party, representation of both indemnifying party and the indemnitee would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between them, then reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party, provided that the indemnifying party approves such counsel.  Neither the indemnifying party nor any indemnitee shall be liable for any settlement of action or claim effected without its consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall retain, assume, or reassume sole control over all expenses relating to every aspect of the defense that it believes is not the subject of the indemnification provided for in this section.  Until both (a) the indemnitee receives notice from indemnifying party that it will defend, and (b) the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnitee may, at any time after ten (10) days from the date notice of claim is given to the indemnifying party by the indemnitee, resist or otherwise defend the claim or, after consultation with and consent of the indemnifying party, settle or otherwise compromise or pay the claim.  The indemnifying party shall pay all costs of indemnity arising out of or relating to that defense and any such settlement, compromise, or payment.  The indemnitee shall keep the indemnifying party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense.  Following indemnification as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided in this Section, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee with respect to the matters for which indemnification has been made.\n\n15.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n     15.1 Representatives of Parties.  All disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall initially be referred to the Account Representatives (as defined in Section 18.1).  If the Account Representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) business days after referral of the matter to them, the managers of the Account Representatives shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after five (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, senior executives of the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after give (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to the chief executive officers of the parties for resolution.\n\n     15.2 Continuity of Performance.  M&I acknowledges that the provision of the Services is critical to the business and operations of Customer.  Accordingly, in the event of a dispute between Customer and M&I, during the pendency of the dispute resolution proceedings described in this Article 15, M&I shall continue to provide the Services and Customer shall continue to pay any undisputed amounts to M&I.\n\n16.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n     16.1 By M&I.  M&I represents and warrants that:\n\n          A.   Capability of Computer Systems and Software.

Customer shall remain the sole and exclusive owner of all Customer Data and other Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), regardless of whether such data is maintained on magnetic tape, magnetic disk, or any other storage or processing device.  All such Customer Data and other Confidential Information shall, however, be subject to regulation and examination by the appropriate auditors and regulatory agencies to the same extent as if such information were on Customer's premises.  \"Customer Data\" means any and all data and information of any kind or nature submitted to M&I by Customer, or received by M&I on behalf of Customer, in connection with the Services.\n\n     17.2 M&I Systems.  Customer acknowledges that it has no rights in any software, systems, documentation, guidelines, procedures and similar related materials or any modifications thereof provided by M&I, except with respect to Customer's use of the same during the Term to process its data.        17.3 Confidential Information.  \"Confidential Information\" of a party\n\n\n\n\n\nshall mean all confidential or proprietary information and documentation of such party, whether or not marked as such, including without limitation with respect to Customer, all Customer Data.

M&I and Customer shall hold the Confidential Information of the other party in confidence and shall not disclose or use such Confidential Information other than for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, and shall instruct their employees, agents, and contractors to use the same care and discretion with respect to the Confidential Information of the other party or of any third party utilized hereunder that M&I and Customer each require with respect to their own most confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care, including but not limited to, the utilization of security devices or procedures designed to prevent unauthorized access to such materials.  Each party shall instruct its employees, agents, and contractors of its confidentiality obligations hereunder and not to attempt to circumvent any such security procedures and devices.  Each party's obligation under the preceding sentence may be satisfied by the use of its standard form of confidentiality agreement, if the same reasonably accomplishes the purposes here intended.  All such Confidential Information shall be distributed only to persons having a need to know such information to perform their duties in conjunction with this Agreement.\n\n     17.5 Security.  M&I shall be responsible for, and shall establish and maintain safeguards against, a disaster, loss or alteration of the Customer Data in the possession of M&I.  Such safeguard shall be no less rigorous than that M&I uses to protect its own data of a similar nature.\n\n18.  MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT\n\n     18.1 Account Representatives.  Each party shall cause an individual to be assigned to the position of Account Representative to devote time and effort to management of the Services under this Agreement.  Neither party shall reassign or replace its Account Representative during the first year of his or her assignment without the consent of the other party, except if such individual voluntarily resigns, is dismissed for cause, or is unable to work due to his or her death or disability.\n\n     18.2 Change Control Procedures.  On or prior to the Conversion Date, M&I shall deliver to Customer the Change Control Procedures to be used by M&I to perform the Services.  At a minimum, the Change Control Procedures shall provide for prior notice to Customer of changes which materially adversely effect the quality or timeliness of the Services, in which case such change shall be made only on a temporary basis.  M&I agrees to schedule projects and changes so as to not unreasonably interrupt Customer's business operations.\n\n     18.3 Reporting and Meetings.  Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate set of periodic reports to be issued by M&I to Customer during the Conversion Period and during the remainder of the Term.

Upon Customer's written request, M&I will develop and provide to Customer a good faith estimate of any additional charges which Customer may incur in connection with the operation of any new software, major modification or enhancements developed by M&I or the acquisition of third party software.  Customer agrees that M&I will have the opportunity to bid on and be considered for all software development, maintenance and other technology projects related to the Services that Customer wishes to implement.\n\n19.  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\n          A.   M&I shall comply with, and M&I shall provide Customer with data and reports necessary for Customer to comply with, all federal laws applicable to the transactions or accounts processed by M&I.  Customer shall have the right to notify M&I of any requirements or changes in state law which affect the provision of the Services.  Thereafter, M&I shall schedule implementation of the changes prior to the deadline imposed by the regulatory or other governmental agency having jurisdiction for such change.  M&I's obligation to meet the compliance deadline shall be contingent upon M&I receiving timely notice from Customer or any other service bureau customer of M&I so as to enable M&I to schedule and implement such change prior to the regulatory deadline.  M&I shall implement such change at Customer's sole cost and expense (shared equitably among all of M&I's other service bureau customers who are affected by such change).\n\n\n\n\n\n          B.   Provided that such enactments or regulations do not prohibit M&I from performing the Services for Customer, M&I shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services regardless of changes in legislative enactments or regulatory requirements.  If such changes prevent M&I from performing its obligations under this Agreement, M&I shall, when appropriate, make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and implement a suitable work around until such time as M&I can perform its obligations under this Agreement without such work around.\n\n20.  DISASTER RECOVERY\n\n     20.1 Disaster Recovery Plan.  M&I shall maintain throughout the term of the Agreement a Disaster Recovery Plan in compliance with all regulatory requirements, which Disaster Recovery Plan shall cover all the Services.  For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Disaster\" means any unplanned interruption of operations which materially affects the ability of M&I to provide Services, or as otherwise provided in the Disaster Recovery Plan.  Review and acceptance of any Disaster Recovery Plan as may be required by any such regulatory organizations shall be the responsibility of Customer, provided that M&I provides Customer and any such regulatory organizations such cooperation and assistance in conducting such reviews as Customer or such regulatory organizations may from time to time reasonably request.  Any Disaster Recovery Plan shall provide, at a minimum, for M&I to provide alternate electrical power supplies for uninterrupted service. The Disaster Recovery Plan shall also designate one or more facilities (each a \"Disaster Recovery Site\") or separate computer resources to which M&I shall move the affected portion of any Services upon the declaration of a Disaster (as provided in the Disaster Recovery Plan) requiring such a relocation.  Any Disaster Recovery Site must be appropriately equipped with data processing resources sufficient to provide all Services in compliance with regulatory requirements.  Any Disaster Recovery Plan must also specify all procedures for the determination or declaration of a Disaster, which determination or declaration may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either party.  A detailed Executive Summary of the Disaster Recovery Plan, as amended from time to time, shall be provided to Customer without charge.\n\n     20.2 Relocation.  M&I shall relocate all affected Services to the Disaster Recovery Site as expeditiously as possible after declaration of a Disaster (as provided in the Disaster Recovery Plan), and shall coordinate with Customer all requisite telecommunications modifications necessary to achieve full connectivity to the Disaster Recovery Site in material compliance with all regulatory requirements.\n\n     20.3 Resumption of Services.  The Disaster Recovery Plan shall provide that, in the event of a Disaster, M&I is able to resume all Services in accordance herewith utilizing the Disaster Recovery Site within a commercially reasonable period following the declaration of any Disaster as provided in the Disaster Recovery Plan.  In the event M&I is unable to resume all Services to Customer within thirty (30) days following the declaration of any Disaster, Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty upon written notice to M&I delivered within forty-five (45) days after declaration of such Disaster.\n\n     20.4 Annual Test.

M&I and Customer acknowledge and agree that the performance of these Services will be subject to regulation and examination by Customer's regulatory agencies to the same extent as if such Services were being performed by Customer.  Upon request, M&I agrees to provide any appropriate assurances to such agency and agrees to subject itself to any required examination or regulation.

Examination of Records.  The parties agree that the records maintained and produced under this Agreement shall, at all times, be available for examination and audit by governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the Customer's business, including any Federal Regulator.
