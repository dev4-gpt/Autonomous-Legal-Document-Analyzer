Any oral representations or modifications concerning this instrument shall be of no force or effect unless contained in a subsequent written modification signed by the party to be charged.\n\n                                   -9-    10\n\n             26.     APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California (without respect to principles of conflicts of law).\n\n             27.     VENUE. Any and all disputes between the parties that cannot be settled by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively in the state or federal courts located within San Luis Obispo County, California, and each party consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably waives any objections thereto, including without limitation, on the basis of improper venue or forum non conveniens.\n\n             28.     ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS. In any action brought under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its actual costs and attorney fees pursuant to California Civil Code section 1717 and all other litigation costs, including expert witness fees, and all actual attorney fees and litigation costs incurred in connection with the enforcement of a judgment arising from such action or proceeding. The provisions of the preceding sentence shall be severable from the provisions of this Agreement and shall survive the entry of any such judgment.\n\n             29.     NO PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE. The parties hereto understand and agree that TrueLink is furnishing its services and the Interface to Client on its own behalf and not on behalf of the System providers. Client understands and agrees that authorization to use the System must be obtained from the System providers. In no event will TrueLink offer the Systems without such authorization from the System providers. Nothing contained herein will be construed to create any association, partnership, joint venture or any agency relationship between the parties hereto.\n\n             30.     FORCE MAJEURE. TrueLink will be excused from delays in performing or from failing to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent the delays or failures result from causes beyond the reasonable control or TrueLink. However, to be excused from delay or failure to perform, TrueLink must act diligently to remedy the cause of the delay or failure.\n\nDated:                                   TRUELINK, INC.\n\n\n\n\n\n   --------------------------\n\n                                     By                                            -------------------------------------                                            Title:\n\nDated:                                  MORTGAGE LOGIC.COM, INC.       --------------------------\n\n                                     By                                            -------------------------------------                                            Title:\n\n                                   -10-    11\n\n                                Exhibit \"A\"\n\n                       Charges for Hosting Services\n\n [To be agreed to by and between TrueLink and Client prior to the Closing]\n\n                                   -11-    12\n\n                                Exhibit \"B\"\n\n                       Charges for Support Services\n\n [To be agreed to by and between TrueLink and client prior to the Closing]\n\n                                   -12-"
