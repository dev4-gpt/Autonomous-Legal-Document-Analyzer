CHARGES\n\nShareholder Plan Enrollment: If Client has appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase and/or dividend reinvestment plan, Agent (on behalf of such affiliate) shall accept requests by Client's shareholders to enroll Shares in such plan via paper enrollment form, in the case of certificated securities, and via paper enrollment form, Internet enrollment and telephonic enrollment, in the case of book-entry (i.e., Direct Registration System) securities. If Client has not appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, then Client hereby appoints and directs a banking affiliate of Agent to implement and administer a share selling program (\"Program\") pursuant to which shareholders may enroll book-entry Shares in the Program in order to liquidate them under the following terms and conditions. The Program transaction fee for each such sale shall be $15.00 plus $0.12 per Share. Under the Program, upon receipt of a sale request by a registered shareholder, Agent (on behalf of such banking affiliate) will process the request through an affiliated registered broker/dealer. Proceeds of each sale under the Program will be sent to the shareholder in the form of a check (less the transaction fee). Sale requests under the Program will typically be combined with other sale requests received from Client shareholders and Shares will be submitted in bulk to an affiliated registered broker/dealer for sale. Shares will be sold under the Program generally within one business day of Agent's receipt (on behalf of such banking affiliate) of the sale request, but in no event more than five business days (except where deferral is necessary under state or federal regulations). The price per Share received by the selling shareholder under the Program will equal the market price Agent (on behalf of such banking affiliate) receives for the Shares (or, if more than one bulk trade is executed on the day the Shares are sold, then the price per Share shall equal the weighted average market price received for all Shares sold that day).\n\nPrior Agent Out-of-Proof Conditions: If an out-of-proof condition exists on the Effective Date, and such condition is not resolved within 90 calendar days thereafter, Client agrees to provide Agent with funds or shares sufficient to resolve the out-of-proof condition promptly upon the expiration of such 90 day period.\n\nLost Certificates: Agent shall charge shareholders an administrative fee for replacement of lost certificates, which shall be charged only once in instances where a single surety bond obtained covers multiple certificates. Agent may receive compensation from surety companies or surety agents for administrative services provided to them.\n\nLegal Expenses, System Modifications: Certain expenses may be incurred in resolving legal matters, including receiving and responding to routine subpoenas that arise in the course of performing services hereunder. This may result in a separate charge to cover Agent's expenses (including the cost of external or internal counsel) in resolving such matters; provided that any legal expenses charged to the Client shall be reasonable.\n\nIn the event any federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations are enacted that require Agent to (i) make any adjustments and/or modifications to its current system, or (ii) B-7\n\n\n\n\n\nprovide additional services to Client for which Agent is not being compensated hereunder, then Client shall compensate Agent (a) on a pro rata basis proportionate to the Client's registered shareholder base, for the costs associated with making such required adjustments and/or modifications, or (b) according to Agent's standard fees established, in good faith, with respect to such additional services.\n\nInitial Compliance Escheatment Services: If, at the time escheat services are commenced for any asset type, Client is not in compliance with applicable state unclaimed property regulations with respect to that asset type, then Agent shall provide initial compliance services, which shall include working with one or more state unclaimed property clearinghouses to identify specific reportable records and property, and organizing and formatting such records and property for remittance to the applicable states, as required. Where applicable, in concert with state clearinghouses, Agent shall also attempt to obtain releases and indemnification agreements protecting Client from interest and penalties that may be assessable against Client by the states for prior non-compliance. If a release or indemnification agreement is not so obtained from a state, Client may be responsible for interest and/or penalties from such state for prior non-compliance. Agent may receive compensation from state clearinghouses for the processing and support services it provides to them in connection with initial compliance services.\n\nCash Dividends and Distributions: For any dividend mailing, Client shall, no later than 10 am Eastern Time on the mail date for the dividend, provide to Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash dividends to be paid. Upon receipt of any such funds, Agent shall (a) in the case of registered shareholders who are participants in a dividend reinvestment plan of Client as of the record date, reinvest such funds in accordance with the terms of such plan, and (b) in the case of registered shareholders who are not participants in any such plan as of the record date, make payment of such funds to such shareholders by mailing a check, payable to the registered shareholder, to the address of record or, if different, dividend mailing address. If Agent has not timely received sufficient funds to make payments of any dividend or distribution pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above to all registered shareholders of Client as of the record date, Agent shall notify Client and withhold all payments until Client has provided sufficient funds to Agent.\n\nOther Services: Fees, out of pocket expenses and disbursements for any services, including, but not limited to, down posting for odd lots, provided to Client or any of its agents or representatives by or on behalf of Agent hereunder that are not set forth above will be based on Agent's standard fees at the time such services are provided or, if no standard fees have been established, an appraisal of the work to be performed.
