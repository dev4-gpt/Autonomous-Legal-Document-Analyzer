Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music      merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at      http://www.musicblvd.com (the \"Sponsor Site\") and other Web sites through      which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.\n\nD.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.\n\nTherefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.\n\n      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The \"Commencement Date\" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below).

Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice                   to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into                   an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as                   Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and                   Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to                   conclude the agreement.\n\n               iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of                   its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have                   the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such                   third party, provided the terms and conditions of the                   agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)                   days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered                   by Sponsor.\n\n                                    3    4                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n2.

This                            three-month Total Revenue amount will be compared to                            an amount equal to two (2) times the corresponding                            three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee                            described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata                            share a \"Revenue Floor\").\n\n                                    8    9                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               iii)     If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period exceeds the total of the Revenue                            Floor applicable to the same three-month period,                            Sponsor will pay Excite [****] of the gross margin                            Sponsor realizes on the gross revenue amount equal to                            the excess of the Total Revenue over the Revenue                             Floor during the three-month period.                   iv)      If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period does not exceed the Revenue Floor                            applicable to the same three-month period, Sponsor                            will not be obligated to pay Excite any share of the                            gross revenue realized during the three-month period.\n\n      g)       Payments of shared gross margin will be due to Excite within                   thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter in which                   the revenue is recognized by Sponsor.\n\n      h)       With each payment, Sponsor will provide to Excite                   documentation reasonably detailing the calculation of the                   payment.\n\n      i)       Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the                   calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite                   may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice                   to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant                   to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the                   calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business                   hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in                   connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless                   the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less                   than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in                   which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the                   reasonable fees for such inspection.\n\n8.

If Excite fails to \"make good\" the shortfall within                   [****] following the first year end, Sponsor may terminate the                   Agreement in accordance with Section 11 (b).\n\n      b)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the second year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall within [****] following the second year end.                   However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite                   has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the                   Excite Site.
