shall cause its Affiliates or, subject to Section 2.2, third parties to provide, to the Company or one or more of its Affiliates (in connection with the conduct of the Business) the services described on Exhibit A hereto (the \"Transition Services\"). Notwithstanding the content of Exhibit A, RGHI agrees to consider in good faith any reasonable request by the Company for access to any additional service that is necessary for the operation of the Business, at fees to be agreed upon after good faith negotiation between the parties. RGHI will not be in in breach of this Agreement if RGHI declines to provide a requested additional service for any good faith reason, including the failure of the Parties to agree to the scope, term, and fee for the additional service. Any such additional services so provided by RGHI shall constitute Services hereunder and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on Exhibit A as of the date hereof.\n\n(b) During the applicable Term of any Service, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates or, subject to Section 2.2, third parties to provide, to RGHI or one or more of its Affiliates, the services described on Exhibit B hereto (the \"Reverse Transition Services\").\n\n(c) In addition to the Services described on Exhibit A hereto, RGHI shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to undertake the segregation and extraction required to separate the IT systems, data, records and processes of the Company, or thereafter created in the conduct of the Business from RGHI's IT environment or infrastructure, and migrate them to RCP's, or any of its Affiliates', IT environment or infrastructure (collectively, the \"Migration Services\"). For the avoidance of doubt, Migration Services apply to services only and do not include the acquisition or supply of any hardware, software, license (except where RGHI, at the request of RCP, acquires such hardware, software, or license at RCP's cost), or ongoing operational support service for the operating environment(s) (except as otherwise contemplated by Exhibit A). The costs of such Migration Services\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nshall be paid by RCP, including any out-of-pocket costs incurred by RGHI or its Affiliates in connection with such Migration Services and for the time spent by RGHI, its Affiliates or their Personnel, as applicable, in providing such Migration Services. RGHI will also provide to RCP any available reasonable documentation around the systems implementation, configuration documents, process maps, or any other documentation related to the systems that are part of the separation. RGHI and RCP shall work together in good faith to develop a detailed plan for migrating RCP's IT systems, data, records and processes to its IT environment or infrastructure (the \"Migration Plan\").\n\nSection 2.2 Performance by Affiliates or Subcontractors. Either Party may, in its sole discretion, engage, or cause one of their Affiliates to engage, one or more parties (including other third parties or Affiliates) to provide some or all of the Services; provided, (i) such Party is using such Affiliate or third party to perform the same Services for itself and its Affiliates (to the extent applicable), (ii) such arrangement would not increase the cost to Recipient for such Services, and (iii) if such third party is not already engaged with respect to such Service as of the date hereof, Provider shall obtain the prior written consent of Recipient (not to be unreasonably withheld). Provider shall (x) be responsible for the performance or non-performance of any such parties and (y) in all cases remain responsible for ensuring that obligations with respect to the standards of Services set forth in Article III of this Agreement are satisfied with respect to any Services provided by such Affiliate or third party.\n\nSection 2.3 Scope of Services. Other than as expressly set forth on Exhibit A, Section 2.1, Exhibit B, or as agreed by the Parties in writing, in no event shall Provider be obligated to provide any Service to the Recipient for any purpose other than to facilitate, on a transitional basis, the Recipient's ability to conduct business as conducted immediately preceding the date hereof.\n\nSection 2.4 Internal Controls and Procedures. In addition to the requirements of Article III and Article VII herein, with respect to the Services provided by RGHI and its Affiliates providing Services hereunder, certain of the Services may involve processes that directly or indirectly support financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports. The Company has an obligation to ensure that it has internal controls over financial reporting that comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and must also ensure that its external auditors can complete their necessary evaluation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards issued by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Company and RGHI and such Affiliates shall use reasonable commercial efforts to agree (i) what key controls over financial reporting will be performed by RGHI and such Affiliates within the processes that directly or indirectly support financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports; (ii) the frequency as to the performance of the agreed key controls; and (iii) the form of documentation required to evidence the effective performance of the agreed key controls. RGHI and such Affiliates will perform the agreed key controls and evidence such performance in the agreed format. Company shall have the right, in a manner to avoid unreasonable interruption to RGHI's or its Affiliates' business, to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the key controls; and (2) upon at least thirty (30) days' written notice to RGHI, perform (through its external auditor) audit procedures over RGHI's internal controls and procedures for the Services provided under this Agreement; provided that such right to audit shall exist solely to the extent reasonably required by Company's external auditors to ensure Company's compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Company shall pay or reimburse all of RGHI's expenses and costs arising from such audit. The performance of the agreed key controls, preparation of documentation, providing access to the Company or its delegate and the Company's auditors will be billed at the agreed rates as set forth on Exhibit A.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE III SERVICE LEVELS; SERVICE COORDINATORS; TSA COMMITTEE\n\nSection 3.1 Quality of Services.\n\n(a) Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the \"Service Standard\"). Subject to Section 3.1(c), internal controls of Provider and its Affiliates with respect to the Service Standard shall remain materially the same in effect throughout the term of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and their Affiliates are not professional service providers of the Services.\n\n(b) In the event of any material failure of a Provider to perform the Services, as applicable, in accordance with the Service Standards, Recipient shall provide Provider with written notice of such material failure, and Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such failure as soon as reasonably possible and in the same manner that Provider would remedy such a failure for their other businesses undergoing such a material failure.\n\n(c) A Provider may, from time to time: (i) reasonably supplement, modify, upgrade, substitute or otherwise alter (\"Change\") any Service in a manner consistent with Changes made with respect to similar services provided by Provider on their own behalf or to their Affiliates, including taking any physical or information security measures with respect to such Service, in a manner that does not (x) adversely affect in any material respect the quality or availability of such Service or (y) materially increase the fees payable in connection with such Changed Service; provided that to the extent that any such Change is reasonably likely to modify, substitute or otherwise alter the receipt or use of such Service, Provider shall provide Recipient with reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of the Change to the extent practicable under the circumstances; provided, further, that the Service Standard shall continue to apply to such Service following any Change. If a Change is required by applicable Law or is in response to a threatened Security Incident, Provider may make any and all changes to the Service necessary to comply with applicable Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such threatened Security Incident in a manner consistent with responses made by Provider on its own behalf or in respect of their Affiliates; provided that Provider shall provide Recipient such reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of any such Change as may be practicable under the circumstances; and (ii) with reasonable advance written notice to Recipient, temporarily suspend the provision of a Service as necessary to conduct Systems maintenance or patching without such suspension constituting a breach of the Service Standard.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) A Provider need not provide any Service if it is not permitted to do so by applicable Law. To the extent that any Service is not permitted pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into arrangements reasonably acceptable to each of the Parties under which the Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such Service were permitted by applicable Law.\n\nSection 3.2 Policies. Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured.\n\nSection 3.3 Service Coordinators and Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a) RGHI and Company shall each nominate a representative to act as the primary contact person with respect to the performance of the Services (each, a \"Service Coordinator\"). Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Parties shall direct all initial communications relating to this Agreement and the Services to the Service Coordinators. The initial Service Coordinators for RGHI and Company, including their contact information, are set forth on Exhibit C. Either Party may replace its Service Coordinator at any time by providing notice and contact information for the newly designated Service Coordinator in accordance with Section 10.5. The Service Coordinators shall oversee the implementation and ongoing operation of this Agreement. The Parties shall ensure that their respective Service Coordinators shall meet in person or telephonically at such times as are reasonably requested by RGHI or Company to review and discuss the status of, and any issues arising in connection with, the Services or this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event a dispute arises between the Parties under this Agreement, telephonic negotiations shall be conducted between the Parties' respective Service Coordinators within ten (10) days following a written request from any Party (\"Dispute Negotiations\").
