Services. The Consultant agrees to perform such consulting, advisory and related services to and for the Company as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company, including, but not limited to, the services specified on Schedule A to this Agreement. The Consultant also agrees to provide the Company with related services that may be requested from time to time by the Company. During the Consultation Period (as defined below) and for a period of one year thereafter, except in connection with his performance of the Services, the Consultant shall not engage in any activity in the field described on Schedule A to this Agreement, and he shall not assist any other person or organization that engages in any such activity.\n\n2. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the four-year anniversary of the Effective Date (such period, as it may be extended, either by the mutual written agreement of the parties or automatically, or earlier terminated being referred to as the \"Consultation Period\"), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 4, and shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods, unless the Company provides 90 days' notice of termination before any such successive period.\n\n3. Compensation.\n\n3.1 Shares. In connection with the execution of this Agreement, Consultant and Company shall enter into a Restricted Stock Agreement. Subject to approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company shall issue and sell to the Consultant, and the Consultant shall purchase from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Restricted Stock Agreement, 1,990,000 shares (the \"Shares\") of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of the Company (\"Common Stock\"), at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $190.

The Consultant further acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which is protectable by copyright is a \"work made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.\n\n(b) The Consultant agrees that if, in the course of performing the Services, the Consultant incorporates into any Invention developed under this Agreement any preexisting invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery or other proprietary information owned by the Consultant or in which the Consultant has an interest (\"Prior Inventions\"), (i) the Consultant will inform the Company, in writing before incorporating such Prior Inventions into any Invention, and (ii) the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to make, have made, modify, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including, without limitation, as part of or in connection with such Invention, and to practice any method related thereto.

The Consultant also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any Inventions.\n\n(d) The Consultant shall promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions and will maintain adequate and current written records (in the form of notes, sketches, drawings and as may be specified by the Company) to document the conception and/or first actual reduction to practice of any Invention. Such written records shall be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times. - 4 -\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Non-Solicitation.

The Consultant further represents that Consultant's performance of all the terms of this Agreement and the performance of the services as a consultant of the Company do not and will not breach any agreement with any third party to which the Consultant is a party (including, without limitation, any nondisclosure or non-competition agreement), and that the Consultant will not disclose to the Company or induce the Company to use any confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any current or previous employer or others.\n\n8.2 The Consultant hereby represents, warrants and covenants that Consultant has the skills and experience necessary to perform the services, that Consultant will perform said services in a professional, competent and timely manner, that Consultant has the power to enter into this Agreement and that Consultant's performance hereunder will not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party or violate any federal, state or municipal laws.\n\n9. Independent Contractor Status.\n\n9.1 The Consultant shall perform all services under this Agreement as an \"independent contractor\" and not as an employee or agent of the Company.

In performing the services, the amount of time devoted by the Consultant on any given day will be entirely within the Consultant's control, and the Company will rely on the Consultant to put in the amount of time necessary to fulfill the requirements of this Agreement. The Consultant will provide all equipment and supplies required to perform the services. The Consultant is not required to attend regular meetings at the Company. However, upon reasonable notice, the Consultant shall meet with representatives of the Company at a location to be designated by the parties to this Agreement. - 5 -\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3 In the performance of the services, the Consultant has the authority to control and direct the performance of the details of the services, the Company being interested only in the results obtained.

Remedies. The Consultant acknowledges that any breach of the provisions of Section 1, 6 or 7 of this Agreement shall result in serious and irreparable injury to the Company for which the Company cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. The Consultant agrees, therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy the Company may have, the Company shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by the Consultant and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond.\n\n11. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address shown above, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 11.\n\n12. Pronouns. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.\n\n13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n\n14. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Consultant.\n\n15. Non-Assignability of Contract. This Agreement is personal to the Consultant and the Consultant shall not have the right to assign any of Consultant's rights or delegate any of Consultant's duties without the express written consent of the Company. Any non-consented-to assignment or delegation, whether express or implied or by operation of law, shall be void and shall constitute a breach and a default by the Consultant. - 6 -\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.\n\n17. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Consultant are personal and shall not be assigned by Consultant.\n\n18. Interpretation. If any restriction set forth in Section 1, 6 or 7 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.\n\n19. Survival. The last sentence of Section 1 and Sections 4 through 20 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n20. Miscellaneous.\n\n20.1 No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.\n\n20.2 The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.\n\n20.3 In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank] - 7 -\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Consulting Agreement as of the date and year first above written.
