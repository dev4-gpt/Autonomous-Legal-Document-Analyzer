GENERAL.\n\n17.1 Entire Agreement/Modifications.\n\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no  representations, warranties, covenants or obligations except as set forth herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous  agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, of the Parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof. This  Agreement and its SCHEDULES may only be amended, modified or superseded by a writing executed by the authorized representatives of the  Parties hereto. It is anticipated that SCHEDULES will be attached to and become part of this Agreement as new RESEARCH PROJECTS are  undertaken, as described in Article 1.1.\n\n17.2 Severability.\n\nThis Agreement, to the greatest extent possible, shall be construed so as to give validity to all of the provisions hereof. If any provision of this  Agreement is or becomes invalid, is ruled illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction or is deemed unenforceable under the current applicable law  from time to time in effect during the term of this Agreement, the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected or impaired thereby and will  continue to be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law. In lieu of each provision which is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, there will be  substituted or added as part of this Agreement by mutual written agreement of the Parties, a provision which will be as similar as possible, in  economic and business objectives as intended by the Parties to such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, but will be valid, legal and  enforceable.\n\n17.3 Waiver.\n\nNo failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement will waive any provision of this Agreement. Nor will any  single or partial exercise by either Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement preclude it from otherwise or further exercising any rights or  remedies which it may have, or any other rights or remedies granted by any law or any related document.\n\n17.4 Enforcement.\n\nIn the event an action is commenced by either Party against the other to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall  be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and necessary disbursements incurred in connection with such  action.

Each Party shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a  third party in conjunction with the transfer to such third party of substantially all of the assets of such Party associated with performance under  this Agreement without such prior consent. \"Affiliated Company\" defined as any company owned or controlled by, under common control with or  controlling CERES, \"control\" meaning in this context the direct or indirect ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock/shares of a  company, or the power to nominate at least half of the directors.\n\n17.6 Force Majeure.\n\nNo Party shall be responsible to the other Party for delay or failure in performance of any the obligations imposed by this Agreement, provided  such failure shall be occasioned by fire, flood, explosion, lightning, wind storm, hailstorm, earthquake, subsidence of soil, failure of machinery or  equipment or supply of materials, discontinuity in the supply of power, court order or governmental interference, terrorist attacks, civil commotion,  riot, war, strikes, labor disturbances, transportation difficulties, labor shortage, natural genetic variation of any living matter or by any other cause  of like or unlike nature beyond the reasonable control and without fault or negligence of such Party.\n\n18. SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH DEFRA AGREEMENT NF 0426.\n\nThe Parties acknowledge that Defra is expected to assign or license exclusively to IGER any rights in Intellectual Property which would vest in  Defra or the Crown or the Secretary of State pursuant to the DEFRA agreement NF 0426. If IGER receives an exclusive license from Defra rather  than an assignment of rights, the following will apply.\n\n18.1 To the extent the license grant to CERES on IGER BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY in Article 5.3.2 relates to IGER  BACKGROUND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY that constitutes Intellectual Property to which rights vest in Defra or the Crown or the Secretary  of State, the word \"license\" will be read as \"sublicense\" and all other terms of such Article will remain unchanged.\n\n18.2 To the extent that IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY created in a RESEARCH PROJECT  constitutes or includes Intellectual Property to which rights vest in Defra or the Crown or the Secretary of State, any conveyance or grant of  rights or licenses by IGER to CERES in this Agreement with respect to such IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or JOINT INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY, will be read as the grant of an exclusive sublicense under IGER's exclusive license from Defra.

CERES and IGER aim  to develop commercial biomass crops from leading Miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: I) propagation; and II) breeding. These  are described in turn below.\n\nI. Propagation.\n\nThe major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the UK, subsidy support makes [***] of  Miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in [***], where there is no government support for the crop  and initial [***] from which to generate planting material is extremely limited.\n\nIt is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of Miscanthus crops for  large markets will be determined by development of\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      BETWEEN   CERES, INC. (\"CERES\"), a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business at 1535 Rancho Conejo Blvd., Thousand  Oaks, CA 91320, United States of America, and\n\n\n\nINSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (\"IGER\"), a company limited by guarantee, registered in  England No. 473456 and a registered Charity No. 272150, having an office at Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3EB,  United Kingdom\n\nA.   Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms of the CA shall apply to this SCHEDULE.\n\nB.   In the event of any difference between the terms of this SCHEDULE and the CA, then the terms of this SCHEDULE shall prevail.\n\nI.A.  Rationale:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncost-effective propagation technology, and the magnitude of success depends on the speed with which this technology can be developed.\n\nAll other lines of crop development research in this collaboration will be dependent on success with propagation.\n\nTo be successful, Miscanthus must be planted from small, homogenous propagules that can be cheaply and rapidly produced, flow-ably  transported, stored for months and consistently emerge after planting. In theory, the best propagule for Miscanthus production is seed. However,  propagation of Miscanthus from seed is complicated and difficult. Development of [***] Miscanthus varieties will be a [***] of the [***] of this  collaboration.\n\nAn alternative approach to seed in the short term is to [***] Miscanthus from [***] as is common in [***]. [***] is more feasible with decreasing  [***] and has not been thoroughly explored in Europe. The potential of [***] should be investigated from both an applied and basic perspective.  It was agreed that while the approach is more likely to work in [***], it should also include x [***] and at least initially [***].\n\nDevelopment of [***] and [***] techniques for [***] Miscanthus cropping systems will utilize a combination of theoretical and applied methods  in the lab, glasshouse and field.\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\nI.B.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.\n\n      I.B.i. Objective 1: Identify [***] techniques and optimize them with existing hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Screen [***], x [***] and other species at least initially for [***] ability with multiple techniques in a broad range of factorial field  and glasshouse experiments. Glasshouse experiments can be conducted year-round at IGER and at CERES in Thousand Oaks, CA.  Additional experiments may be conducted at other CERES locations added at a later date. Field experiments will be conducted [***] at IGER  and begin in multiple locations in [***] during the three (3) year period of this SCHEDULE.\n\n      I.B.ii. Objective 2: More basic genetic and physiological work aimed at characterising and understanding [***].\n\n      Methods: A series of experiments into the [***] of [***] with a focus on inducing plant growth from [***] ([***] and [***]) [***]. Work  should explore [***] cues ([***], [***], [***]) as well as [***] ([***]). Explore [***] and score in [***] if possible, to locate [***].  Evaluate candidate [***] (from Arabidopsis, [***] if possible and other species) promoting [***] frequency.\n\nI.C.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.\n\n      I.C.i. Objective 1: Demonstrate potential of [***] and create protocols.\n\n      Methods: Check [***] of [***] and [***] of a wide range of [***] in response to [***] and [***] with a combination of [***], glasshouse  and finally field experiments. Interpret results in context of [***] range, genotype and [***] conditions under which the [***] was [***].  Produce guidelines for effective [***] and [***].\n\nI.D.  Goal: [***] based systems for rapid [***] of germplasm and plants to be used in [***].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Breeding\n\nMiscanthus is an unimproved plant species with great potential as an energy crop. [***] has not yet been fully collected and characterized.  Miscanthus species are capable of crossing with [***] \u2014 a characteristic that has long been exploited in [***] where Miscanthus germplasm is  used to [***]. The use of Miscanthus for biomass is a relatively new area, thus initial collection and evaluation of germplasm may discover lines  already suited to the commercial market, and will certainly provide the base for the breeding needed to develop [***] into dedicated bioenergy  crops. This breeding programme will employ traditional methodology to [***] and [***] for traits of interest. Molecular markers will be developed  to assist identification of traits and expedite development of elite lines. Major traits of interest include increased biomass production, altered  composition for improved conversion to fuel, [***] tolerance and seed suitable to produce [***] ([***]) [***].\n\nAs lines with commercial potential are identified they will be selected for direct field trialing at IGER and/or at CERES locations in [***] to speed up  commercial variety development.\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      I.D.i. Objective 1: Provide plants for [***] based [***].\n\n      Methods: [***] plants using clean systems for shipment to [***] in accordance with international regulations.\n\n      I.D.ii. Objective 2: Investigate [***] in [***] of lines potentially useful in breeding, including hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Evaluate the [***] capacity of breeding line candidates in response to standard or improved [***] techniques.\n\n      I.D.iii. Objective 3: Develop estimates of time and cost required to [***] plants in [***] based systems.\n\n      Methods: Conduct a desk study to compare the costs/benefits and barriers associated with large scale [***] methodology including [***].\n\nI.E.  Goal: Proof of Concept field trials of research findings in target locations.\n\n      I.E.i. Objective 1: Evaluate and optimize propagation techniques under commercially relevant conditions.\n\n      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing methods in the UK and at multiple locations in [***] and elsewhere. These  should expand on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions, with a focus on potentially commercial  genotypes.\n\n      I.E.ii. Objective 2: Evaluate and optimize germplasm performance in the UK and in multiple [***].\n\n      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing at multiple locations in the UK, [***] and elsewhere. These should expand  on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions with a focus on potentially commercial genotypes.\n\nII.A.  Rationale:\n\nII.   B. Goal: A complete and documented Miscanthus [***].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      II.B.i. Objective 1: [***] to [***] in [***].\n\n      Methods: In accordance with international conventions, e.g., the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), [***] Miscanthus [***] from the  [***] of [***]. Document the phenotype and growing [***], using [***] to accurately record the [***]. [***] to [***] for [***] and  subsequent phenotype documentation.\n\n      II B.ii. Objective 2: Characterize full [***].\n\n      Methods: Document the morphological, physiological and [***] of interest in the [***] using consistent phenotyping nomenclature and  [***] compositional analysis. Develop molecular markers associated with phenotypic traits.\n\n      II.B.iii. Objective 3: Assess relatedness of plants identified as useful parents for hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Use molecular markers developed for traits of interest in combination with germplasm characterization data, particularly [***], to  select parents with desired traits that are also likely to present [***].\n\n      II.B.iv. Objective 4: Develop a dynamic warehouse to store data and develop systems to analyse data and support multidisciplinary  collaborative research.\n\n      Methods: IGER and CERES to consider best options for developing the database. Populate the database with the [***] and [***]  information [***]. As germplasm is characterized, integrate phenotype and marker data and use to facilitate choice of promising [***] lines  as well as inform the preparation needed to ensure [***] (e.g. [***]). As data become available from other components of the collaborative  research, such as field trialing and conversion analysis, it will be added to the database to allow PIs to synergistically design next step  experiments.\n\nII.C.  Goal: Improved Miscanthus hybrids for commercial use.\n\n      II.C.i. Objective: Select improved parents.\n\n      Methods: [***] within [***] using information from molecular markers and composition analysis to shorten and streamline the selection of  parents. Cross between [***] and evaluate hybrids to identify improved parents.\n\n      II.C.ii. Objective: Make crosses of selected [***] lines.\n\n      Methods: Appropriate germplasm will be selected for crossing using the database decision tool. Plants will be [***] to [***] in  glasshouses and [***] made both in the glasshouse and outdoors at IGER, depending on time of year. Improve efficiency of [***] and, for  [***], [***]. Determine [***] \u2014 and [***]. Send seed of [***] candidates and [***] to CERES locations for trialing.\n\n      II.C. iii Objective: Selection of superior [***].\n\n      Methods: [***] will be transplanted to field. Important morpho-physiological traits will be recorded over [***] years after which the best  genotypes will be selected, [***] and [***] into rhizomes. The value of early prediction of traits will be assessed. A mass selection  reservoir (MSR) will be maintained as a safety net and to contain interesting genotypes that do not justify commercial development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      II.C.iv. Objective: Field evaluation of hybrids.\n\n      Methods: From rhizomes taken in iii, replicated trials will be established. After [***] (or [***]) years, the best genotypes will be provided to  CERES to test at diverse locations for commercially relevant evaluation.\n\n      II D. Goal: Improved Miscanthus Varieties.\n\n      II.D.i. Objective: Explore new methods of breeding.\n\n      Methods: Set up and test [***] in terms of [***] and [***].

agreed upon for contract years 1 through 3. A contract year (\"Year\") is April 1 \u2014 March 31, starting April 1, 2007. CERES agrees to  provide funding for IGER's RESEARCH PROJECT activities covered by this SCHEDULE in accordance with Article 1.8 of the CA as set forth in the  Budget in page 1 of this Attachment B, taking into account what is provided hereinafter. Pay Costs, Other Recurrent and Other Costs are as in the  Budget. Overhead Costs will be payable as follows:\n\nPage 2\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n  -    Each contract year CERES will pay [***]% of the overheads asked, (e.g. of the [***] pounds in Year 1), for the expected reasonable  performance in the various aspects of the program Year by Year and especially for all the items listed in the attached document. This  [***]% amounts to [***] pounds in contract Year 1.\n\n  -    Furthermore, CERES will pay for Year 1 an additional [***]% of the asked overhead ( i.e.[***]% in total of the asked overhead) for full  completion of the Year 1 items A and B listed hereinafter. This additional [***]% equals [***] pounds.\n\n  -    For Year 2 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 2 items A and C  hereinafter.\n\n  -    For Year 3 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 3 items A, B, C  and D listed hereinafter.\n\n  -    The MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE will bring forth recommendations to the Parties at the beginning of each Year for the items that IGER  should satisfy to obtain extra overheads, outlined in the framework above.\n\n  -    Assessment on achievements of the nominated items will be made at the end of each Year by the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE and  recommendations made to the Parties. Upon agreement, CERES will respond to an invoice from IGER as agreed. Should some items in a  section not be achieved then the amount paid will be reduced on a pro-rata basis on the number of items in the section.
