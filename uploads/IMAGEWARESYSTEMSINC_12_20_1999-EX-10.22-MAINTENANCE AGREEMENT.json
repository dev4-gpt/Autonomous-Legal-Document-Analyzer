DEFINITIONS\n\nThe terms defined in this Section shall have the meaning as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means MORPHO will require the Kuwait Government to contact MORPHO maintenance personnel for all problems associated with the installed Force Field PSS System. MORPHO will respond with fixes and/or workarounds to keep the system operational. MORPHO personnel may document any software problems and refer them to XIMAGE for additional fixes or patches.\n\nSECOND LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means if Morpho's personnel can not start or keep the system operational because of software problems, XIMAGE should be contacted to provide all documented and replicated software Errors. XIMAGE will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance.\n\nPROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e. December 10, 1993.\n\nERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement. Error includes malfunctions and defects.\n\n                                          Page 3\n\n2.   TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\nXIMAGE's obligations hereunder shall become effective upon the      \"Effective Date\" and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall      remain in full force and effect for at least one year thereafter. This      Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms      at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term      unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice      of the non-renewal of this Agreement.\n\n3.   SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICES\n\nXIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software      Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service      (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error,      malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that      the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set      forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to      MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of      the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or      neglect of the products by MORPHO. In addition, XIMAGE will provide the      following as additional Customer Support Services:\n\n(a)  telephone support as reasonably requested by MORPHO at the rate of           $100 per hour for all hours in excess of 40 hours in any one-year           term;\n\n(b)  on-site visits to MORPHO's sites as determined to be necessary by           Morpho for Error correction, unless error correction is normally           performed via Dial up from the XImage facility in San Jose;\n\n(c)  give title to all modifications and improvements to the PSS           Software which XIMAGE generally makes available to its other           customers (at no additional Charge) under standard software           maintenance agreements relating to the Software.\n\nIf MORPHO requests XIMAGE to perform any other services, the related terms and conditions shall be based on further separate agreement between the parties. This Agreement and the rights and duties contained herein are not be deemed to cover maintenance services with respect to hardware. Such may be decided in accordance with paragraph 9.\n\n4.   PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES\n\nWhen XIMAGE provides Software Maintenance Services which require the use      of the hardware portion of equipment which utilizes the Software (the      \"Equipment\"), MORPHO shall make such Equipment available to XIMAGE at and      for reasonable times, and in no event will MORPHO charge XIMAGE for such      use of such Equipment. All Software Maintenance Services covered by the      Maintenance Charges will be performed during the regular business hours      of XIMAGE (Monday-Friday, exclusive holidays). If Software Maintenance      Services are performed outside regular business hours, MORPHO will pay      the additional charges, if any, as at XIMAGES then current charges.\n\n                                         Page 4\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

CHARGES\n\nThe total annual maintenance charge amounts to US $24502 for the first      year of maintenance. MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement,      including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within thirty (30) days      after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE. Thereafter, the then      applicable Annual Maintenance Charge shall be invoiced to, and paid by      MORPHO prior to the beginning of the next annual maintenance period. All      other charges under this Agreement shall be invoiced by XIMAGE and shall      be due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice.      The Annual Maintenance Charge includes all federal, state, county,      local, or other taxes arising in the United States or its states (or      other internal jurisdictions), but does not include all taxes arising      under any law other than that of the United States.

Each party will not      disclose the Confidential Information to any person except its employees      or consultants to whom it is necessary to disclose the Confidential      Information for such purposes.

Each party will immediately give notice to the      Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential      Information. The Recipient agrees to assist the disclosing party in      remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential      Information. This obligation will not apply to the extent that the      Recipient can demonstrate:\n\n(a)  the disclosed information at the time of disclosure is part of the           public domain;\n\n                                         Page 5\n\n(b)  the disclosed information became part of the public domain, by           publication or otherwise, except by breach of the provisions of this           Agreement;\n\n(c)  the disclosed information can be established by written evidence to           have been in the possession of the Recipient at the time of           disclosure;\n\n(d)  the disclosed information is received from a third party without           similar restrictions and without breach of this Agreement; or\n\n(e)  the disclosed information is required to be disclosed by a           government agency to further the objectives of this agreement, such           as to obtain permission to distribute the Program of by a proper           court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the           Recipient wil use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of           such information and will consult with and assist the Disclosing           Party in obtaining a protective order prior to such disclosure.\n\n8.   RESPONSE BY XIMAGE.\n\nXIMAGE will maintain a 24 hour a day reporting facility to accept calls      from MORPHO. XIMAGE agrees to respond to any telephone call made, within      30 minutes.\n\n9.   INTERVENTION ON SITE.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that MORPHO require the attendance of an XIMAGE engineer on      site, XIMAGE shall upon such a demand (either written or verbal) make      their best efforts to dispatch the engineer as expeditiously as      possible. XIMAGE undertake to have an engineer on site in Kuwait within      72 hours from the time the request was made, exclusive of the time      required to arrange for travel and obtain the required documents, and      the actual travel time itself.      In such cases where on site intervention is required MORPHO shall pay      for all travel expenses (Business Class), hotel accomodation and      reasonable subsistence. XIMAGE shall charge for the time of the engineer      only when he/she is on site or in exceptional circumstances when away      from the site but directly involved in work connected with the PSS.      XIMAGE will not charge for travel time.\n\nAll interventions on site are subject to a minimum total charge of      $2,000.

XImage is not required to send an engineer to the Kuwait site if either      active or potentially pending hostilities exist in the region, and a      reasonable person might fear the possibility of bodily harm.\n\n                                         Page 6\n\n10.  RETURN AND REPAIR\n\nMORPHO may, at its option, return equipment to XIMAGE for repair. XIMAGE      will make its best efforts to liaise with the supplier of the equipment      and to expeditiously repair and return the equipment. XIMAGE reserves the      right to charge an administration fee of $100 per shipment in such cases.\n\n11.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF/TERMINATION\n\nMORPHO acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the provisions of      Section 7 herein by MORPHO will result in irreparable harm to XIMAGE and      that money damages would provide inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in      addition to any other rights and remedies available to XIMAGE hereunder      or at law, XIMAGE shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable      relief to restrain any such violation and to such other and further      relief as a court may deem proper under the circumstances.
