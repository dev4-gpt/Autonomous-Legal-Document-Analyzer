Board Nomination.\n\n(a) Subject to the satisfactory completion of the Company's customary background check, the Board shall appoint the ValueAct Designee to serve as a director beginning within ten (10) calendar days following receipt of the ValueAct Group's written request to the Company to have the ValueAct Designee appointed to the Board; provided that, at such time, the Board does not conclude in good faith and based on the written opinion of outside legal counsel that such appointment would constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties. If the ValueAct Designee is appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall include the ValueAct Designee as a Class I Director, which term expires at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.\n\n(b) As a condition to the ValueAct Designee's appointment to the Board, the ValueAct Group, including the ValueAct Designee, agrees to provide to the Company information required to be or customarily disclosed for directors, candidates for directors, and their affiliates and representatives in a proxy statement or other filings under applicable law or stock exchange rules or listing standards, information in connection with assessing eligibility, independence and other criteria applicable to directors or satisfying compliance and legal obligations, and such other information as reasonably requested by the Company from time to time with respect to the ValueAct Group and the ValueAct Designee.\n\n(c) The ValueAct Designee agrees that, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, he will (i) meet all director independence and other standards of the Company, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10A- 3; and (ii) be qualified to serve as a director under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") (clauses (i) and (ii), the \"Conditions\"). The ValueAct Designee will promptly advise the Nominating Committee if he ceases to satisfy any of the Conditions.\n\n(d) At all times while serving as a member of the Board, the ValueAct Designee shall comply with all policies, procedures, processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to Board members, including the Company's Code of Business Conduct, Insider Trading Policy, Executive Stock Ownership Policy as in effect on the date hereof, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, and (except as permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 7 below)) preserve the confidentiality of Company business and information, including discussions or matters considered in meetings of the Board or Board committees to the extent not disclosed publicly by the Company.   1\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) So long as the ValueAct Group collectively beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 7.5% of the outstanding Common Stock, if, during the Covered Period, a vacancy on the Board is created as a result of the ValueAct Designee's death, resignation, disqualification or removal, then the ValueAct Group and the Company (acting through the Board) shall work together in good faith to fill such vacancy or replace such nominee with an individual who (A) meets the Conditions, (B) meets the historical standards and criteria applied by the Company in nominating and appointing directors, and (C) is otherwise mutually acceptable (in each of their sole discretion) to the ValueAct Group and the Company, and thereafter such individual shall serve and/or be nominated as the \"ValueAct Designee\" under this Agreement.\n\n(f) The Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate immediately, and the ValueAct Designee shall promptly offer to resign from the Board, and any committee of the Board on which he then sits (and, if requested by the Company, promptly deliver his written resignation to the Board (which shall provide for his immediate resignation) it being understood that it shall be in the Board's sole discretion whether to accept or reject such resignation) if: (i) members of the ValueAct Group, collectively, cease to beneficially own at least 7.5% of the Company's outstanding Common Stock; (ii) the ValueAct Designee ceases to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (c)-(d) above; (iii) a member of the ValueAct Group, including the ValueAct Designee, otherwise ceases to comply or breaches any of the terms of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; or (iv) the employment of the ValueAct Designee with the ValueAct Group is terminated for any reason. The ValueAct Group agrees to cause the ValueAct Designee to resign from the Board if the ValueAct Designee fails to resign if and when requested pursuant to this Section 1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the occurrence of an event set forth in subsection (ii) or (iv) above, the provisions of Section 1(e) must be complied with before the Company's obligations hereunder may terminate.\n\n(g) The percentage thresholds set forth in clauses (e) and (f) above shall not be deemed unsatisfied to the extent a failure to maintain the specified ownership thresholds is the result of share issuances or similar Company actions that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\n2.
