Integration, Severability and Amendment. This Agreement (including the exhibits) sets forth the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement will be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other term herein. This Agreement may not be amended or otherwise modified except in a written agreement signed by each party. 17. Waiver. A provision of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party waiving compliance. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Failure of either party to exercise promptly any right, power or privilege granted by this Agreement, or to require strict performance of any obligation undertaken by the other party pursuant to this Agreement, will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right, power or privilege or of the right to demand subsequent performance of any and all such obligations undertaken by the other party. 18. Notice. Any notice, request or demand to be made under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly made (a) upon delivery, if delivered personally (by courier service or otherwise), as evidenced by written receipt or other written proof of delivery (which may be a printout of the tracking information of a courier service that made such delivery), or (b) five (5) days after deposit in the mail, if sent by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the party for whom intended at the address listed on the signature page. A party may change its address for the purposes of this Section 18 by written notice hereunder given to the other party. 19. Further Documentation. Each party agrees, at the reasonable request of the other, to promptly execute and deliver all such further documents, and to promptly take or forbear from all such action, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to more effectively confirm or carry out the provisions of this Agreement. 20. Survival. Sections 6, 7, 9, 10 and 14-24 of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. To the extent that Company receives any trade secrets of Reed's, Company's obligation to protect such trade secrets and abide by the terms of Section 7 shall survive for so long as such information is a bona fine trade secret pursuant to the laws of the governing jurisdiction identified in Section 14. 21. Remedies. All rights and remedies of either party hereto are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies. The parties acknowledge that any material breach, including without limitation the disclosure of Confidential Information, will cause irreparable injury. In addition to any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available, either party will be able to obtain immediate injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or permanent injunction against the other party to enforce the terms of this Agreement. 22. Fees and Expenses. Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses in connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement. 23. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for the purposes of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the contents of this Agreement. 24. Counterparts.
