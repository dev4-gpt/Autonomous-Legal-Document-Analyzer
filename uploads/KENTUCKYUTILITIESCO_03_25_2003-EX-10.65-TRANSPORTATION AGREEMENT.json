Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.   1.2 EQUIVALENT QUANTITY - shall be as defined in Article I of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.   ARTICLE II - TRANSPORTATION   Transportation Service - Transporter agrees to accept and receive daily on a firm basis, at the Point(s) of Receipt from Shipper or for Shipper's account such quantity of gas as Shipper makes available up to the Transportation Quantity, and to deliver to or for the account of Shipper to the Point(s) of Delivery an Equivalent Quantity of gas.   ARTICLE III - POINT(S) OF RECEIPT AND DELIVERY   The Primary Point(s) of Receipt and Delivery shall be those points specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.   ARTICLE IV   4.1 All facilities are in place to render the service provided for in this Agreement.   4.2 Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's Tariff (\"GT&C\"), Transporter shall cause the delivery of natural gas to Shipper at the Shipper's Primary Point of Delivery as nearly as practicable to Transporter's line pressure, provided that such line pressure shall not be less than 500 pounds per square inch gauge at Monroe, meter number 020843, and 600 pounds per square inch gauge at Calvary, meter number 020844.

In the event Transporter is unable to maintain the minimum pressure(s) described herein but Shipper is still able to take receipt of the scheduled quantity at the Primary Delivery Point(s) described above, then Shipper shall be considered unharmed by Transporter's inability to maintain such minimum pressure(s). Subject to the foregoing, any failure on Transporter's part to deliver the scheduled quantity at the Primary Delivery Point(s)   1\n\n\n\n\n\n  described above shall entitle Shipper to the limited remedy specified in Rate Schedule FT-A, Section 7 - Failure of Transporter.
