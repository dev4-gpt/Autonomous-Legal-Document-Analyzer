The Distributor Agreement is hereby amended by adding thereto a new Section 15.11 and a new Section 15.12, which shall read in their entirety as follows:                           Section 15.11  Right of First Refusal.  If, at any time or from           time to time during the term hereof, Licensor or any stockholder in           Licensor shall have received a bona fide offer from any person or           entity to sell, transfer or otherwise convey all or any stock in, or           assets of, Licensor which Licensor or such stockholder, as the case           may be (the \"Offeree\"), desires to accept, the Offeree shall first           give written notice (the \"Offering Notice\") to Licensee of the           financial and other terms and conditions (the \"Terms and Conditions\")           of such offer.  Licensee shall have the right and a first opportunity           to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, all or           the applicable portion of such stock or assets (as specified in the           applicable Offering Notice) on the Terms and Conditions set forth in           the Offering Notice, such right to be exercised by notice in writing           to the Offeree within ninety (90) days after the giving of the           Offering Notice.  If Licensee shall have exercised such right, the           closing shall be held at the corporate offices of Licensee on the           closing date specified in the Offering Notice or the date that is           ninety (90) days after the date of Licensee's notice of its exercise           of such right, whichever is later.  If either party shall default           under this Section, the other party shall be entitled to specific           performance.  If Licensee shall fail to give notice of the exercise of           its right of first\n\n                                          4\n\n          refusal under this Section within such ninety (90) day period, or if           Licensee shall notify the Offeree within such ninety (90) day period           that Licensee has waived such right, then the Offeree shall have the           right to sell, transfer or convey all or the applicable portion of the           stock in, or assets of, Licensor (as specified in the Offering Notice)           pursuant to the terms of the specific offer described in the           applicable Offering Notice, but not otherwise.  If such sale, transfer           or conveyance is not consummated in accordance with the offer and the           Terms and Conditions specified in the applicable Offering Notice, the           rights of Licensee to an Offering Notice shall be reinstated.  No           exercise or waiver by Licensee of any of its rights hereunder shall           modify, abridge, impair or affect any of Licensee's rights under any           of the other terms or provisions of this Agreement.  Any sale,           transfer or other conveyance of all or any part of the stock in, or           assets of, Licensor in violation of this Section shall be null and           void.  Skunkware, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the sole           stockholder of Licensor (\"Skunkware\"), is joining in this Agreement           for the purpose of agreeing to the terms of this Section and Section           15.12.\n\n               Section 15.12  OPTION TO PURCHASE.  Skunkware and Licensor hereby           grant to Licensee the exclusive and irrevocable right and option to           purchase (the \"Option\"), at Licensee's election, either (i) all of the           assets of Licensor or (ii) all of the issued and outstanding stock of           Licensor.  Such option shall be exercisable during a period (the           \"Option Period\") commencing on and including the earlier of (i) the           date upon which Licensee shall have paid to Licensor, in any single           fiscal year of Licensee, royalty payments hereunder in the aggregate           amount of $10,000,000 or (ii) January 1, 2002, and ending upon the           expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement.  Licensee's           exercise of the Option is at its sole discretion.  Licensee may           exercise the Option by written notice to Licensor and Skunkware at any           time during the Option Period.  Upon any such exercise of the Option,           Licensee and Licensor or Skunkware (as the case may be) shall proceed           to diligently and in good faith negotiate and execute a definitive           purchase and sale agreement for Licensor's acquisition of all of the           assets of, or outstanding capital stock in, Licensor, as the case may           be.  In the event that Licensee and Licensor or Skunkware, as the case           may be, are unable to agree on any terms or conditions for such           acquisition, the same shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance           with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association,           with the arbitrator(s) to be experienced in the mainframe software           industry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provision for arbitration           concerning the terms of any purchase and sale agreement, and without\n\n\n\n\n\n          limiting any other\n\n                                          5\n\n          conditions that may be included in any such purchase and sale           agreement, Licensee shall have no obligation to consummate the           acquisition of the assets of, or stock in, Licensor pursuant to its           exercise of the Option if Licensee's board of directors should           determine, in its sole discretion, that such acquisition would not be           accretive to the value of Licensee.  The definitive purchase and sale           agreement shall provide that License may pay the purchase price           thereunder in cash, in shares of its Common Stock or in some           combination thereof.  So long as the Option shall be in existence           (whether or not exercisable), Skunkware and Licensor agree that           Licensor will conduct its business in the ordinary course and will           not, without the prior written consent of Licensee, merge or           consolidated with any other entity, sell all or substantially all of           its assets, grant or permit to exist any lien or encumbrance on any           material portion of its assets, issue any securities to any person           other than Skunkware or engage in any other transaction or enter into           any other agreement other than in the ordinary course of business.            Skunkware further agrees that, so long as the Option shall be in           existence (whether or not exercisable), it shall be and remain the           sole Stockholder Licensor, and Licensor shall not issue to any other           person or entity any stock, warrants or similar rights to acquire           equity interests in Licensor.\n\n     9.
