Term and Termination.\n\n5.1  Term. The Term will commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement and      will remain in effect, unless sooner terminated under paragraphs 5.2, 5.3,      or 5.4, until the termination date specified in Exhibit A.\n\nThe Term will automatically renew for successive additional periods of one (1) year each, provided that: (a) Distributor has made all Guaranteed Minimum Purchases and has complied with the marketing requirements under paragraph 4.1(b); (b) the parties have agreed in writing upon the Guaranteed Minimum Purchase amounts and Product price discounts for the next subsequent one (1) year renewal period; (c) neither party provided the other party with notice of such party's intention not to renew this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to any year's Expiration Date; and (d) neither party provided the other party with such notice as may be required pursuant to paragraphs 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4.\n\n5.2  Termination by WGT. Upon the occurrence of any of the following, WGT may      terminate the Term by giving Distributor written notice of such termination      for:\n\n(a)  any failure of Distributor to comply with the marketing requirements under      paragraph 4.1(b);\n\n(b)  any material change in the general management, ownership or control of      Distributor, including without limitation the sale, transfer or      relinquishment by Distributor of any substantial interest in the ownership      of the business to be carried on by Distributor under this Agreement,      unless such change is approved in advance and in writing by an officer of      WGT;\n\n(c)  any assignment or attempted assignment of this Agreement by Distributor      without the prior written consent of WGT;\n\n(d)  any solicitation by Distributor for the sale of the Product to resellers      located outside the Territory;\n\n                                       5\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)  the insolvency of Distributor, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or      against Distributor, the appointment of a receiver for Distributor or      Distributor's property, the execution of an assignment by Distributor of      all or substantially all of its assets for the benefit of its creditors, or      the conviction of Distributor or any principal or manager of Distributor      for any crime tending to adversely affect the ownership or operation of      Distributor's business;\n\n(f)  any failure by Distributor to perform any of its other obligations under      this Agreement where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after      written notice thereof by WGT to Distributor; or\n\n(g)  WGT giving Distributor ninety (90) days' advance written notice of      termination at any time after the expiration of the Initial Term.\n\n5.3  Failure to Make Guaranteed Minimum Purchases. Upon any failure by      Distributor to make Gross Purchases in sufficient amounts to meet or exceed      the applicable cumulative Guaranteed Minimum Purchases, WGT may, at its      sole option and effective upon notice to Distributor, terminate this      Agreement. Distributor shall pay WGT fifty percent (50%) of the unpaid      balance of cumulative Guaranteed Minimum Purchase amounts as liquidated      damages. The parties acknowledge and agree that it would be difficult or      impossible to calculate WGT's actual damages arising from Distributor's      failure to timely pay all of the Guaranteed Minimum Purchases. Therefore,      the parties have agreed upon the above payment of liquidated damages in      lieu of WGT's claim for actual damages from such breach.\n\n5.4  Termination by Distributor. Upon the occurrence of any of the following,      Distributor may terminate the Term by giving WGT written notice of such      termination;\n\n(a)  the insolvency of WGT, the filing of a petition by or against WGT, the      appointment of a receiver for WGT or WGT's property, or the execution of an      assignment by WGT of all or substantially all of its assets for the benefit      of its creditors;\n\n(b)  any failure by WGT to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement      where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice      thereof by Distributor to WGT; or\n\n(c)  for convenience whether or not extended beyond the Initial Term, provided      Distributor gives WGT thirty (30) days' advance written notice and, within      such thirty (30) day period, Distributor pays to WGT a lump-sum payment      equal to fifty (50%) of the unpaid balance of cumulative Guaranteed Minimum      Purchase amounts.\n\n5.5  Effect of Termination. Any termination pursuant to paragraphs 5.2, 5.3, or      5.4 will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy afforded to      either party under this Agreement or any applicable law (e.g., in the case      of any breach or default by the other party), and will not affect any      rights or obligations which have arisen prior to the date of such      termination. In the event of termination, Distributor will:\n\n                                       6\n\n(a)  immediately cease to demonstrate, market, sublicense and distribute the      Product in the Territory;\n\n(b)  cease use of all Trademarks of WGT;\n\n(c)  return to WGT within twenty (20) days following the expiration or      termination of the Term, any and all (i) demonstration Product provided to      Distributor; (ii) Products not already paid for in full by Distributor; and      (iii) promotional literature, data, information and other items received by      Distributor under this Agreement; and\n\n(d)  furnish WGT with such information relating to the marketing, sale or      distribution of the Product in the Territory as WGT may reasonably request      (including, but not limited to, information as to calls or the status of      any negotiations for the sale of the Product, or any sales or service      records).\n\nUpon the expiration or termination of the Term, the license granted under Section 2 of this Agreement will terminate. Any end-user licenses of the Software granted under the terms of this Agreement will survive the end of the Term in accordance with the terms of the applicable end-user license agreement.\n\n5.6  Acknowledgment. Any expiration or termination of the Term will be final and      absolute. Except as expressly set forth in paragraphs 5.3 and 5.5(c),      Distributor waives any right, either express or implied by applicable law      or otherwise, to the renewal of this Agreement or to any damages or      compensation for any expiration or termination of the Term in accordance      with this Section 5. Each of the parties have considered the possibility of      such expiration or termination and the possibility of loss and damage      resulting therefrom in making expenditures pursuant to the performance of      this Agreement. It is the express intent and agreement of the parties that      neither will be liable to the other for damages, except as expressly set      forth in paragraphs 5.3 and 5.5(c), or otherwise by reason of the      expiration or termination of the Term as provided for herein.\n\n6.0  Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in      breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or\n\n\n\n\n\n     failure to perform as required by this Agreement (other than for payment      under Section 3), as a result of any cause or condition beyond such party's      reasonable control.\n\n7.0  Entire Agreement. This Agreement is subject to the provisions of WGT's      Standard Distributor Terms attached hereto as Exhibit B and by this      reference incorporated into and as part of this Agreement. This Agreement      is also subject to any additional terms or licenses executed by WGT and      Distributor and attached as Exhibits, including any Special Terms and      Conditions specified in Exhibit A. This Agreement sets forth the entire      agreement, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, among the parties      related to the Product. WGT will not be bound by, and specifically objects      to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in      addition to the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not it would      materially alter this Agreement) and that is proffered by Distributor or      otherwise appears in any order, receipt, acceptance, confirmation,      correspondence, or otherwise, unless WGT specifically agrees to such      provision in a written instrument signed by WGT. No\n\n                                       7\n\n     modifications of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be valid      unless set forth in a written instrument signed by both parties. Any remedy      by WGT set forth in this Agreement is in addition to any other remedy      afforded to WGT under any other contract, by law, or otherwise.\n\nIN WITNESS THEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\n\nDistributor:                               WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.\n\nBy: /s/ LAURENCE GILBERT                   By: /s/ WATCHGUARD    -------------------------                  ------------------------------\n\nTitle: MANAGING DIRECTOR                   Title: VP/SALES\n\nDate Signed: NOVEMBER 5, 1997              Date Signed: NOVEMBER 3, 1997\n\nAddress:  20/24 Church Street              Required Signature:           Altrincham, Cheshire           WA14 4DW, ENGLAND                By:                                                 -------------------------------                                            Title: Executive Vice-President Sales\n\n                                           Date Signed:                                                          ---------------------\n\n                                           Address:  316 Occidental Avenue South                                                      Suite 300                                                      Seattle, Washington  98104\n\n                                       8\n\n                    FULL SERVICE MASTER DISTRIBUTOR SCHEDULE                                     EXHIBIT A\n\nPRODUCTS:\n\nDistributor will be entitled to order the following products (which includes hardware and software) at the following discounts of WGT's then current WatchGuard Price List:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        DISCOUNT FROM WGT'S                                  PRODUCT                  THEN CURRENT                                                       WATCHGUARD PRICE LIST - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WatchGuard Security System                             40% plus additional                                                        10% on the remaining                                                  undiscounted amount, i.e., 46%\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXCHANGE FEE:                                      $10 per CD SUPPORT FEE:                                       $25,000 per year\n\n                                                                  CUMULATIVE                                                                   GUARANTEED                                                                     MINIMUM                                                                    PURCHASES                               DATE OF ORDER                     (U.S. DOLLARS) - -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- Upon contract signing                              $100,000.00 1st subsequent Quarter-end, Sept. 30, 1997         $100,000.00 2nd subsequent Quarter-end, Dec. 31, 1997          $167,000.00 3rd subsequent Quarter-end, Mar. 31, 1997          $234,000.00 4th subsequent Quarter-end, Jun 30, 1997           $300,000.00\n\n\n\n\n\nTERMINATION DATE:                                           September 30, 1997 TRADEMARKS:\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM)\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM) Technologies\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM) SchoolMate\n\n/bullet/  Firebox(TM)\n\nTERRITORY:\n\n/bullet/  Europe\n\nSPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                                       9\n\nThese Special Terms and Conditions are part of the Distributor Agreement between WatchGuard Technologies, Inc. (\"WGT\") and Distributor (collectively, the \"Agreement\"). Terms that are defined in the Distributor Agreement will have the same meaning when used in these Special Terms and Conditions.\n\nSection A.1 By joint agreement between WGT and Distributor, Distributor may engage in end user sales in the Territory.\n\nIf it is agreed that Distributor may engage in end user sales, Distributor may distribute, license and sell up to 20% of the Product purchased from WGT directly to end-users in the Territory. Further, Distributor agrees that high end-users satisfaction is a condition of its continued authorization by WGT. To ensure high end-user satisfaction, Distributor shall: (a) provide quality first level support to its end-user customers; (b) promptly report to WGT all suspected and actual problems with any WGT product; (c) assist WGT in tracing WGT Products to particular end users to distribute critical WGT Product information, locate WGT Products for safety reasons, or to be discover unauthorized marketing or infringing acts; (d) avoid deceptive, misleading or unethical conduct which are or might be detrimental to WGT or its WGT product; and (e) refrain from marking any representation, warranty or guarantee to end users with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the WGT Product that is inconsistent with the literature distributed by WGT or this Agreement.\n\nSection A.2 Distributor is legally organized under the jurisdiction of a country belonging to the European Union.\n\nIf Distributor is organized under the jurisdiction of the country belonging to the European Union, the following clause is hereby appended to Section 1(c) of the Standard Distributor Terms:\n\n         \"PROVIDED HOWEVER, the foregoing restriction is not intended to          preclude Distributor from fulfilling, and Distributor may fulfill,          unsolicited orders for Product received from outside the Territory but          within the European Union (and Distributor shall provide WGT written          notice of any such Sales);\"\n\nSection A.3 As a Full Service Master Distributor, Distributor agrees to sign up a minimum of 10 new WatchGuard resellers in the Territory within the Initial Term of the Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- Distributor:                                 WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.:\n\nBy:  /s/ LAURENCE GILBERT                    By:  /s/ WATCHGUARD      --------------------------                   ----------------------------- Title: MANAGING DIRECTOR                     Title: SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT/SALES                                                      Date Signed:  NOVEMBER 5, 1997               Date Signed:  NOVEMBER 3, 1997  -------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------\n\n                                       10\n\n                           STANDARD DISTRIBUTOR TERMS                                     EXHIBIT B\n\nThese Standard Distributor Terms are part of the Distributor Agreement between WatchGuard Technologies, Inc. (\"WGT\") and Distributor (collectively, the \"Agreement\"). Terms that are defined in the Distributor Agreement will have the same meaning when used in these Standard Distributor Terms.\n\n 1.  Reservation of Rights. The Software is licensed, not sold, to Distributor.      PARAGRAPH 2.2 LICENSE GRANT of the Distributor Agreement sets forth the      entirety of Distributor's rights to use, market, distribute, demonstrate      and otherwise deal with the Product. All rights in and to the Product not      expressly granted to Distributor under this Agreement are hereby expressly      reserved to WGT without restriction. Without limiting the generality of the      foregoing, Distributor will comply with the following:\n\n(a)  Distributor will distribute the Product to resellers only pursuant to a      reseller agreement that substantially conforms to the term of this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement;\n\n(b)  Distributor will not market, demonstrate or distribute the Product outside      the Territory and Distributor will not supply the Product to any reseller      that Distributor knows or has reason to know (i) intends to distribute the      Product outside the Territory or (ii) intends to use or install the Product      outside the Territory;\n\n(c)  Distributor will market, sell and distribute the Product only in its      original, unopened package as received from WGT under the terms of the      end-user license agreement and limited hardware warranty, as applicable,      originally included in the Product package;\n\n(d)  Distributor will not modify or make copies of the Product or translate or      port the Software into any other computer or human language;\n\n(e)  Distributor will not disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or repackage      all or any component of the Product or otherwise attempt to discover any      portion of the source code or trade secrets related to the Product;\n\n(f)  Distributor will not remove, alter, distort, cover or modify any notice of      copyright, trademark or other proprietary right appearing in or on any item      included with the Product or its packaging; and\n\n(g)  Distributor will not register, attempt to register or assist anyone else to      register, directly or indirectly, the Trademarks or any copyright or other      proprietary rights associated with the Product in the Territory or      elsewhere other than in the name of WGT, without WGT's prior written      consent.\n\n2.   Protection Against Unauthorized Use. Distributor will promptly notify WGT      of any unauthorized use of the Product or the Trademarks which comes to      Distributor's attention. In\n\n                                       11\n\n     the event of any such unauthorized use by Distributor's employees, agents      or representatives, Distributor will use its best efforts to terminate such      unauthorized use and to retrieve any copy of the Product in the possession      or control of the person or entity engaging in such unauthorized use.      Distributor will immediately notify WGT of any legal proceeding initiated      by Distributor in connection with such unauthorized use. WGT may, at its      option and expense, participate in any proceeding and, in such event,      Distributor will provide such authority, information and assistance related      to such proceeding as WGT may reasonably request to protect WGT's      interests.\n\n3.   Use of Trademarks. WGT reserves all rights in and to the Trademarks and all      other trademarks and trade names used by WGT in connection with the      Products, but WGT grants to Distributor the nonexclusive right to use and      display the Trademarks during the Term to promote and identify the Product      in the Territory in connection with this Agreement. Distributor will comply      with the trademark guidelines and procedures established by WGT in      Distributor's use of the Trademarks including without limitation use of the      trademark and copyright symbols as specified by WGT from time to time. When      using the Trademarks, Distributor will include a statement acknowledging      that the Trademarks are owned by WGT. Distributor hereby acknowledges that      the goodwill associated with its use of the Trademarks inures solely and      exclusively to WGT and that Distributor does not acquire any rights in the      Trademarks as a result of such use. Distributor will not use the Trademarks      or any confusingly similar name, marks, logos, designs or artwork as part      of Distributor's name, trade name, trademark or artwork without WGT's prior      written consent.\n\n 4.  Independent Contractor. Distributor is an independent contractor, not an      employee, agent or franchisee of WGT. Distributor will not represent or      hold itself out as an employee, agent or franchisee of WGT. Distributor      does not have any authority to, and will not, create or assume any license,      warranty or other obligation, express or implied, on behalf of WGT. This      Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as creating or evidencing      any association, joint venture or partnership between the parties or as      imposing any partnership or franchisor obligation or liability on either      party.\n\n 5.  Delivery. WGT will deliver all Products ordered by Distributor F.O.B.      carrier at WGT's shipping location as determined by WGT from time to time,      on or before the delivery date set forth in each accepted order.      Distributor will pay or reimburse WGT for all shipping charges, premiums      for freight insurance, inspection fees, duties, import and export fees,      assessments, transportation and other costs incurred by WGT to transport      the Product to the shipping destination.\n\n 6.  Resale. Distributor represents that all Products acquired under this      Agreement are acquired solely for demonstration, licensing or sale (as      applicable) and distribution to resellers or end-users in the Territory      without intervening use by Distributor. Distributor acknowledges that the      prices set forth in this Agreement have been established in reliance upon      such representation and that different prices may apply to any Products      acquired for any other purpose. Upon WGT's request, Distributor will      furnish WGT evidence of such resale (including but not limited to      satisfactory evidence of exemption from retail sales, use or similar taxes      that may otherwise apply to transactions under this Agreement).\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\n7.   Software Update Exchange. Once each Quarter during the Term of this      Agreement, Distributor shall have the right to exchange any prior version      of the Software then in Distributor's inventory for an equivalent quantity      of Software containing Updates, subject to Distributor paying WGT an      \"Exchange Fee\" set forth in Exhibit A, for each copy of the Software      exchanged hereunder. WGT will invoice Distributor for and Distributor shall      pay all Exchange Fees as provided in Exhibit A. WGT will deliver all such      exchanged Software Updates in accordance with paragraph 5. Distributor      shall return to WGT the copies of the prior versions of the Software      exchanged under this paragraph 7 at Distributor's expense.\n\n8.   Records; Audit. During the Term and for twenty-four (24) months thereafter,      Distributor will keep and maintain accurate accounts and records regarding      the Products sold and Product license keys delivered to resellers and      end-users under this Agreement. Upon WGT's request, Distributor will      provide access to such records for examination, reproduction, and audit by      WGT or its representatives. Any such audit will be conducted at such times      and in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Distributor's      normal operations. If any such audit discloses that Distributor is      deficient in its compliance with the terms and conditions of this      Agreement, Distributor will immediately pay to WGT any deficiency, plus      interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month running      from the date originally due until the date paid. Acceptance of any payment      by WGT will be without prejudice to WGT's rights to an audit under this      paragraph 8 or any other rights or remedies afforded to WGT under any other      provision of this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n9.   Taxes. The Guaranteed Minimum Purchases and other amounts specified in this      Agreement do not include sales, use or value added taxes, customs fees,      duties or other governmental taxes or charges. Distributor will pay all      such taxes and charges. In the event Distributor is required under any      applicable law to withhold any taxes or duties from the amounts specified      under this Agreement, payment of the amounts specified under this Agreement      will be net of such withholding taxes or duties. Distributor will pay the      amount of all such withholding taxes and duties and supply WGT with      information concerning the amount and type of tax withheld and any      certificates concerning payments of such withholding taxes.\n\n10.  Interest. Any amount not paid when due will be subject to finance charges      at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum      rate permitted by applicable law; whichever is less, determined and      compounded on a daily basis from the date due until the date paid. Payment      of such finance charges will not excuse or cure Distributor's breach or      default for late payment. If WGT retains a collection agency, attorney or      other person or entity to collect overdue payments, all collection costs,      including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, will be payable by      Distributor.\n\n11.  Confidentiality. Any information received by Distributor in performance of      this Agreement relating to the business affairs, customers, markets,      finances, methods, Product, technology, trade secrets or proprietary rights      of WGT will be treated as confidential and proprietary information of WGT.      Distributor will not disclose such information, unless the information is      in the public domain at the time of disclosure through no fault of      Distributor or WGT consents to the disclosure in writing. Distributor will      disclose such information only to its\n\n                                       13\n\n     employees whose duties justify their need to know such information and who      have agreed to copy with Distributor's confidentiality obligations      hereunder.\n\n12.  Ownership. The Product involves valuable patent, copyright, trade secret,      trade name, trademark and other proprietary rights of WGT. No title to or      ownership of such proprietary rights is transferred to Distributor under      this Agreement or by use of any trademark, copyright or other proprietary      right. WGT reserves all of its copyright, trade secret and other      proprietary rights in the Product. Distributor will not infringe, violate      or contest and will take appropriate steps and precautions for the      protection of, such proprietary rights.\n\n13.  Implementation. Distributor will take at WGT's expense, all action during      or after the Term that is reasonably requested by WGT for the      implementation of the ownership provisions of this Agreement or to      evidence, perfect or protect WGT's ownership of this Product and the      proprietary rights associated with ownership of the Product (including,      without limitation, the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of      instruments of conveyance, patent, copyright, trademark or other      proprietary rights registration applications or other documents.)\n\n14.  Warranty; Returns. WGT will permit Distributor and end-users purchasing      through resellers to return any defective Product in accordance with the      limited warranty contained in the applicable end-user license agreement or      limited hardware warranty, as applicable, provided that the Distributor and      end-user have compiled with the applicable warranty terms and conditions.      In order to receive the remedy provided for hereunder, Distributor shall\n\n\n\n\n\n     deliver to WGT a sample of the Product which Distributor finds to be      defective in workmanship or materials, or damaged in shipment prior to      Distributor assuming the risk of loss or damage , along with a written      explanation of the alleged defect within thirty (30) days from the later of      Distributor's initial receipt of such Product from WGT or from the delivery      of such Product to an end-user. In the event WGT verifies a defect reported      by Distributor and such defect affects more than one (1) Product, then at      WGT's option, Distributor shall either certify destruction of all defective      Products or return all Products which it alleges are defective to WGT.      Distributor, reseller or the end user will be responsible for      transportation charges for such Product units sent to WGT's facilities for      service. Provided that WGT is able to verify the presence of the reported      defect in such units, transportation charges, via a mode of transportation      chosen by WGT, shall be borne by WGT to return the Product units from WGT's      location to the Distributor, reseller or the end-user's location. Upon      verification of a defect in one or more Products returned in accordance      with the foregoing, or upon Distributor's certification that it has      destroyed any defective Product in compliance with WGT's instructions, WGT      will, at its option, either issue a credit to Distributor in the amount of      the purchase price paid or payable for such Product by Distributor or      replace the defective Product with an identical (non-defective) Product.      Such remedy will be exclusive and in full satisfaction of Distributor's      claims hereunder.
