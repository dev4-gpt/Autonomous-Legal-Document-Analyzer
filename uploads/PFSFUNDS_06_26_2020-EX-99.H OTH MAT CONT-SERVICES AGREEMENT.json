The Adviser may obtain reimbursement from the Fund, at such time or times as the Adviser may determine in its sole discretion, for any expenses advanced by the Adviser that the Fund is obligated to pay, and such reimbursement shall not be considered to\n\n2\n\nbe part of the Adviser's compensation pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Record Keeping and Other Information. The Adviser shall create and maintain all necessary records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, records required by Section 31(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust.

The Adviser shall make available to the Trust during regular business hours all records and other data created and maintained pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Agreement for reasonable audit and inspection by the Trust or any regulatory agency having authority over the Trust.\n\n6. Compensation. For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate of 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million.\n\nThe average value of the daily net assets of a Fund shall be determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust or a resolution of the Board of Trustees, if required. If, pursuant to such provisions, the determination of net asset value of a Fund is suspended for any particular business day, then for the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the net assets of a Fund as last determined shall be deemed to be the value of the net assets as of the close of the business day, or as of such other time as the value of the Fund's net assets may lawfully be determined, on that day. If the determination of the net asset value of a Fund has been suspended for a period including such month, the Adviser's compensation payable at the end of such month shall be computed on the basis of the value of the net assets of the Fund as last determined (whether during or prior to such month).\n\n7. Limitation of Liability. The Adviser may rely on information reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Except as may otherwise be required by the Act or the rules thereunder, neither the Adviser nor its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof (collectively, the \"Adviser Employees\") shall be subject to any liability for, or any damages, expenses or losses incurred by the Trust in connection with any error of judgment, mistake of law, any act or omission in connection with or arising out of any services rendered under or payments made pursuant to this Agreement or any other matter to which this Agreement relates, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of any such persons in the performance of the duties of the Adviser under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the obligations and duties of the Adviser under this Agreement. Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent of the Adviser, who may be or become a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or\n\n3\n\nacting on any business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Adviser's duties hereunder), to be rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent, or one under the control or direction of the Adviser, even though paid by it. The Adviser is responsible for any information that it provides to the Trust for inclusion in the prospectus and/or statement of additional information of the Fund. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n8. Services for Others. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Adviser or any affiliated person of the Adviser from providing services for any other person, firm or corporation, including other investment companies; provided, however, that the Adviser expressly represents that it will undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely affect the performance of its obligations to the Trust under this Agreement.\n\n9. Renewal and Termination. The term of this Services Agreement shall begin on the date of execution and shall continue in effect for a period of two years. This Services Agreement shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser such compensation as may be payable for the period prior to the effective date of such termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management Agreement is assigned or otherwise terminated.\n\n10. The Trust. The term \"PFS Funds\" means and refers to the Trustees from time to time serving under the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust as the same may subsequently thereto have been, or subsequently hereto may be, amended. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trust hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Trustees, officers, employees, agents or nominees of the Trust, or any shareholders of any series of the Trust, personally, but bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of the Fund).
