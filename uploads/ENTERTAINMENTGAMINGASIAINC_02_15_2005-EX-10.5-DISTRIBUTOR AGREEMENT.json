By either Vendor or Distributor, following a material or continuing breach of this Agreement (in the case of a breach which is capable of remedy) by the other party and the breaching party's failure to cure such breach within ninety (90) days of receiving written notice of such breach, where a breach shall be considered capable of remedy if the party in breach can comply with the provision in question in all respects other than as to the time of the performance (provided that the time of performance is not of the essence); or\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.1.4. Subject to Section 1.6, by Vendor (or successor to Vendor), upon written notice to Distributor of a change of control of Vendor and the election by Vendor (or successor to Vendor) to terminate this Agreement, where a \"change of control\" shall mean a change in ownership of the Vendor such that an unaffiliated third party acquires a majority of the voting power of Vendor;\n\n  1.1.5.
