The arbitrators will rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and will have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.\n\n(e) Each Party will pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of any arbitration; provided, however, that the Parties will equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrators; provided, further, that in the event any action, suit, arbitration, or other proceeding is instituted or commenced by either Party against the other Party arising hereunder, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and costs of arbitration from the non-prevailing Party (it being agreed that the arbitrators and/or judge may eliminate or reduce such recovery on the grounds that it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the harm suffered). 32\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 28.9 to the contrary, either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.
