Investment Banking  10 South Wacker Drive, Suite 3400  Chicago, Illinois 60606\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nAthens Bancshares Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (the \"Company\"), and Athens Federal Community Bank, a federal savings bank located  in Athens, Tennessee (the \"Bank\") (references to the \"Bank\" include the Bank in mutual or stock form as indicated by the context), the deposit  accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), hereby confirm their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette &  Woods, Inc. (the \"Agent\") as follows:\n\nSection 1. The Offering. The Bank, in accordance with its plan of conversion adopted by its Board of Directors (the \"Plan\"), intends to convert  from a federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the \"Conversion\"), and issue all of its issued and outstanding  capital stock to the Company. The Conversion will be accomplished pursuant to federal law and the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the \"OTS\"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Company will offer and sell up to shares (subject to increase up to shares) of its common stock,  $.01 par value per share (the \"Shares\" or \"Common Shares\"), in a subscription offering (the \"Subscription Offering\") to (1) depositors of the Bank  with Qualifying Deposits (as defined in the Plan) as of March 31, 2008 (\"Eligible Account Holders\"), (2) the employee stock ownership plan  established by either the Bank or the Company (the \"ESOP\"), (3) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits as of September 30, 2009  (\"Supplemental Eligible Account Holders\"), and (4) other depositor and borrower members of the Bank as defined in the Plan. Subject to the prior  subscription rights of the above-listed parties, the Company may offer for sale in a community offering (the \"Community Offering\" and when  referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the \"Subscription and Community Offering\") the Shares not subscribed for or  ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a  preference given first to natural persons who are residents of Blount, Bradley, Hamilton, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Meras, Monroe and Polk  Counties in Tennessee. It is anticipated that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain  members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the \"Syndicated Community Offering\") (the  Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the \"Offering\"). It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the  Company may reject, in whole or in part, any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.\n\nIn connection with the Conversion and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as described in the Prospectus, immediately following the consummation  of the Conversion, subject to the approval of the Bank's depositors and compliance with certain conditions as may be imposed by regulatory  authorities, the Company will contribute $100,000 and 100,000 shares of Common Stock to the Athens Federal Foundation (the \"Foundation\") such  shares hereinafter being referred to as the (\"Foundation Shares\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-   )  (the \"Registration Statement\"), containing a prospectus relating to the Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933  (the \"1933 Act\"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term  \"Registration Statement\" shall include any documents incorporated by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as  amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  initially became effective is hereinafter called the \"Prospectus,\" except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)  of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the prospectus on file at the time  the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term \"Prospectus\" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from  and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.\n\nIn accordance with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion Regulations\"), the Bank has filed with the OTS an  Application For Conversion on Form AC (the \"Form AC\"), including the Prospectus and the Conversion Valuation Appraisal Report prepared by  Keller & Company, Inc. (the \"Appraisal\") and has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The Form AC has been  approved by the OTS and the related Prospectus has been authorized for use by the OTS. In addition, the Company has filed with the OTS its  Application H-(e)l-S (the \"Holding Company Application\") to become a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as  amended (\"HOLA\") and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the \"Control Act Regulations\").\n\nSection 2. Retention and Compensation of Agent. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby appoint  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Common Shares and to  advise and assist the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary).\n\nOn the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement, dated June 9, 2009, between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) (the \"Engagement Letter\"). It is  acknowledged by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\nThe obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\nIn the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of    Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the  Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus  accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the  action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (d) below.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) A management fee of $30,000 payable in four consecutive monthly installments of $7,500 each commencing with the execution of the  Engagement Letter. This fee shall be deemed to have been earned when due and shall be non-refundable.\n\n(b) A success fee upon completion of the Offering of 1.125% of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Shares sold in the Subscription  Offering and Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Bank's officers, directors, or employees (or members of their immediate  family), any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock-based compensation plans (except IRAs) or similar plan created by the Bank or the Company for some or  all of its directors or employees, or contributed to any charitable foundation established by the Bank in connection with the Conversion. In no  event shall the success fee paid for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be applied against the first success fee.\n\n(c) If any of the Common Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will seek to form a  syndicate of registered broker-dealers (\"Selected Dealers\") to assist in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the selected dealers agreement. The Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will pass onto the Selected Dealers who assist in  the Syndicated Community Offering an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of  stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases effected with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be transmitted by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to utilize Selected Dealers will be made by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent.\n\n(d) The Company and the Bank shall reimburse the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Company and the Bank will reimburse the Agent for the fees and expenses of the Agent's  counsel which will not exceed $50,000. The Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without  limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, \"Blue Sky,\" and FINRA filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys,  appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the conversion; and the fees set  forth under this Section 2; and any fees for Blue Sky legal work.\n\nFull payment of the Agent's actual and accountable expenses, advisory fees and compensation shall be made in next day funds on the earlier of  the Closing Date or a determination by the Bank to terminate or abandon the Offering. The payment of such expenses assume no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be increased by mutual consent, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would require an  update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing.\n\nSection 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of  all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release  for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable to the Company, the Bank and the Agent. Certificates for shares shall be delivered\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndirectly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions. The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the shares sold in the  Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the \"Closing Date.\"\n\nSection 4.

If required to be filed, the Company has filed any issuer free writing  prospectus related to the offered Shares at the time it is required to be filed under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations and, if not required to be  filed, will retain such free writing prospectus in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g) of the 1933 Act Regulations and if any issuer free  writing prospectus is used after the date hereof in connection with the offering of the Shares the Company will file or retain such free writing  prospectus as required by Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations.\n\n(c) As of the Applicable Time, neither (i) the Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus(es) issued at or prior to the Applicable Time and  the Statutory Prospectus, all considered together (collectively, the \"General Disclosure Package\"), nor (ii) any individual Issuer-Represented  Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material  fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading.

At the time of the approval of the Form AC, including the  Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto) by the OTS and at all times subsequent thereto until the Closing Date, the Form AC,  including the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto), will comply in all material respects with the Conversion Regulations,  except to the extent waived or otherwise approved by the OTS. The Form AC, including the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement  thereto), does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the representations and  warranties in this Section 4(e) shall not apply to statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company by the Agent or its counsel expressly regarding the Agent for use in the Prospectus contained in the Form AC under  the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\"\n\n(f) The Company has filed the Holding Company Application with the OTS and the Holding Company Application is accurate and truthful.

No approval of any other regulatory or  supervisory or other public authority is required in connection with the distribution of the Prospectus and any supplemental sales literature that  has not been obtained and a copy of which has been delivered to the Agent. The Company and the Bank have not distributed any offering  material in connection with the Offering except for the Prospectus and any supplemental sales material that has been filed with the Registration  Statement and the Form AC and authorized for use by the Commission and the OTS. The information contained in the supplemental sales material  filed as an exhibit to both the Registration Statement and the Form AC does not conflict with information contained in the Registration Statement  and the Prospectus.\n\n(h) The Plan has been adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank and, at the Closing Date, will have been approved by the  members of the Bank, and the offer and sale of the Shares will have been conducted in all material respects in accordance with the Plan, the  Conversion Regulations except to the extent waived or otherwise approved by the OTS, and all other applicable laws, regulations, decisions and  orders, including all terms, conditions, requirements and provisions precedent to the Offering imposed upon the Company and the Bank by the  OTS, the Commission, or any other regulatory authority and in the manner described in the Prospectus.

The information under the caption \"The Conversion  and Stock Offering \u2014 Material Income Tax Consequences\" has been reviewed by such counsel and fairly describes the federal and state tax  opinions rendered by them and Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC, respectively, to the Company and the Bank with respect to such matters.\n\nIn addition, such counsel shall state that during the preparation of the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, the Registration Statement,  the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, they participated in conferences with certain officers of, the independent public and internal  accountants for, and other representatives of, the Company and the Bank, at which conferences the contents of the Form AC, the Holding  Company Application, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package and related matters were discussed and,  while such counsel have not confirmed the accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information contained in the Form AC, the  Holding Company Application, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package and do not assume any  responsibility for such information, based upon such conferences and a review of\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocuments deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their opinion (relying as to materiality as to factual matters on certificates of officers and  other factual representations by the Company), nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the Form AC, the Holding  Company Application, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto as of  the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements, the notes thereto, and other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included  therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\nIn giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on certificates of officers or directors of the Company and the Bank and  certificates of public officials. Such counsel's opinion shall be limited to matters governed by federal laws and by the laws of Tennessee and with  respect to enforceablity, New York law, and may add other qualifications and explanations on the basis of this opinion as may be reasonably  acceptable to the Agent.\n\n(d) A Blue Sky Memorandum from Kilpatrick Stockton LLP relating to the Offering, including Agent's participation therein, and should be  furnished to the Agent with a copy thereof addressed to Agent or upon which Kilpatrick Stockton LLP shall state the Agent may rely.

(ii) since the date the Prospectus became authorized for final use, no event has occurred which should have  been set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus which has not been so set forth, including specifically, but without limitation, any  material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties or business of the Company or the Bank and  the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied; (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings, capital, properties or business of the Company or the Bank independently, or of the Company and the Bank considered as one  enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (iv) the representations and warranties in Section 4 are true and correct with  the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date; (v) the Company has complied in all material respects with all  agreements and satisfied all conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date and will comply in all material  respects with all obligations to be satisfied by them after the Closing Date;

(ii) neither the Company nor the Bank  shall have received from the OTS or the FDIC any direction (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their  business with which it has not complied (which direction, if any, shall have been disclosed to the Agent) or which materially and adversely would  affect the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and the Bank taken as a whole;

and (v) the Shares shall have been qualified or registered for offering and sale or exempted therefrom under the securities or  blue sky laws of the jurisdictions as the Agent shall have reasonably requested and as agreed to by the Company and the Bank.\n\n(h) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Agent shall receive a letter from Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC, dated as of the date  hereof and addressed to the Agent: (i) confirming that Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC is a firm of independent registered public accountants within  the applicable rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and stating in effect that in its opinion the consolidated  financial statements and related notes of the Company as of December 31, 2008, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December  31, 2008, and covered by their opinion included therein, and any other more recent unaudited financial statements included in the Prospectus  comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and related published rules and regulations of the OTS and  the 1933 Act; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not an audit in accordance with standards of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)) consisting of a reading of the latest available consolidated financial statements of the  Company prepared by the Company, a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors, Executive Committee and Audit Committee  of the Company and the Bank and consultations with officers of the Company and the Bank responsible for financial and accounting matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:\n\n(A) audited consolidated financial statements and any unaudited interim financial statements included in the Prospectus are not in conformity with  the 1933 Act, applicable accounting requirements of the OTS and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied  on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Prospectus; or\n\n(B) during the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the Prospectus to a specified date not more than three business  days prior to the date of the Prospectus, except as has been described in the Prospectus, there was any increase in borrowings of the Company,  other than normal deposit fluctuations for the Bank; or (C) there was any decrease in the net assets of the Company\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat the date of such letter as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included in the Prospectus; and (iii) stating that, in addition  to the audit referred to in their opinion included in the Prospectus and the performance of the procedures referred to in clause (ii) of this  subsection (h), they have compared with the general accounting records of the Company, which are subject to the internal controls of the  Company, the accounting system and other data prepared by the Company, directly from such accounting records, to the extent specified in such  letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Prospectus as the Agent may reasonably request; and they have found such amounts and  percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).\n\n(i) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Hazlett,  Lewis & Bieter, PLLC in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section 8, the \"specified date\" referred to in clause (i) of  subsection (h) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (h) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three  business days prior to the Closing Date.\n\n(j) At the Closing Date, the Company shall receive a letter from Keller & Company, Inc., dated the Closing Date (i) confirming that said firm is  independent of the Company and the Bank and is experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisals within the meaning of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations, Section 563b.200(b), (ii) stating in effect that the Appraisal prepared by such firm complies in all material respects  with the applicable requirements of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and (iii) further stating that its opinion of the aggregate pro forma  market value of the Company including the Bank, as most recently updated, remains in effect.\n\n(k) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive: (i) a copy of the letters from the OTS approving the Form AC, the Holding Company  Application and authorizing the use of the Prospectus and the establishment of the Foundation, including the issuance of shares thereto;

 and all proceedings taken by the Company and the Bank in connection with the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in  form and substance to the Agent and its counsel.\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(n) All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory  in form and substance to the Agent and to counsel for the Agent. Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company or the Bank and delivered  to the Agent or to counsel for the Agent shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Bank, as the case may be, to the  Agent as to the statements made therein.\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Company and the Bank jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and  agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against  any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent  or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any expense (including all fees and disbursements of  counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims  (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the  General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or any instrument or document executed by the Company or the Bank or based upon written information supplied by the  Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state  or jurisdiction to exempt the Company or the Bank as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the  securities laws thereof (collectively, the \"Blue Sky Application\"), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication (\"Sales  Information\") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank with its consent and based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim  an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the  foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based  upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information  or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this  paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or  alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer- Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales  Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding  the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent regarding  the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements\"; and, provided  further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Bank, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls  the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,  damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to  which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Company,  the Bank, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by  them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or  threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any  amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or  any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other  documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was  omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or  Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel  regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by  the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\"\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or  threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall  not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own  expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly  with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the  indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that  there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying  party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the  indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may  retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or  claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\nSection 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in  Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Bank or the Agent, the  Company, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or  proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other parties  thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the  Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the  allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by  such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Bank on the one hand  and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on  the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by  the Company and the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and  equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not  take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result  of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any  such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be  required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to  the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this  Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company, the Bank and the  Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For  purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's, the Company's or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the  Agent or the Company or the Bank within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on  the one hand, or, the Company or the Bank on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of  commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against  another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall  not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section  10.\n\nSection 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the Company, the Bank and the Agent, the  representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and  the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Company, the Bank or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Shares, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the Company and the Bank,  and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this  Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in  the Agent's reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except  that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved  in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the  Company on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if  there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Bank, or if the Bank shall have  sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or  not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or  business of the Bank.\n\n(b) In the event the Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in  accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion Regulations, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon  refund by the Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such  person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder,  except as set forth in Sections 2(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or  by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Company of  such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any  party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company and the Bank shall be notified promptly by telephone  or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\nThe Company or the Bank may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or  covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the Company or the Bank has provided the Agent with notice of such  breach.\n\nThis Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.\n\nSection 13.
