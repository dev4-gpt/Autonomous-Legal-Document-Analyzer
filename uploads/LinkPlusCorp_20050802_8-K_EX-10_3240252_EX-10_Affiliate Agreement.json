DEFINITIONS\n\n         1.1      Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise                   requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not                   capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other                   terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then                   throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings                   respectively ascribed to them.\n\n2.       OFFICE SPACE\n\n         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide                   Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's                   corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.\n\n         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two                   individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient                   for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and                   not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have                   access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections,                   conference room, and printers.\n\n         2.3      If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own                   purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without                   having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with                   comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to                   provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's                   facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best                   interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford                   Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new                   facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial                   rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent                   office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's                   license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days                   notice.\n\nSource: LINK PLUS CORP, 8-K, 8/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\n         2.4      Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all                   equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property                   that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business.                   LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities                   or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated.\n\n         2.5      LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's                   equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property;                   Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk.\n\n         2.6      Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use                   the office space and to move out of the office space at any                   time upon two weeks notice.\n\n         2.7      Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in                   accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease                   for the space.\n\n         2.8      Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers,                   directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and                   guests (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") harmless from                   and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may                   incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office                   space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the                   Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or                   omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors                   and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric                   or in the office with the permission of Axiometric.\n\n3.

The following shall be the general          roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR          efforts:\n\n         3.1      AMR Products\n\n                  3.1.1    Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are                            jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading                            of residential water utility meters (hereafter the                            Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device                            with integral software. The software includes, under                            license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking                            intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of                            interfacing with a variety of water meter registers,                            recording water usage, logging various exceptional                            conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The                            Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network                            with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting                            range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh                            networking intellectual property. The Water Meter                            software and hardware are based on existing                            Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software                            products; joint ownership of the Water Meter does not                            convey joint ownership of those existing products or                            of the mesh networking intellectual property.\n\n                           New software and hardware designs and intellectual                            property developed in the course of the Water Meter                            development are jointly owned; specifically, the                            algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water                            Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data                            collection), the specific hardware designs related to                            water register interface, battery power management,                            and other intellectual property specifically\n\nSource: LINK PLUS CORP, 8-K, 8/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\n                           described and mutually agreed in writing as                            amendments to this Agreement.

Axiometric has also                            developed mesh networking intellectual property to                            allow the meter inserts to relay information from                            insert to insert thus extending the range and                            reliability of such information transmissions.
