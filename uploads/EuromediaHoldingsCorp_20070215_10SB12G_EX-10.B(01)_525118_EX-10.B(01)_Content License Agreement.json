RIGHTS GRANTED   Licensor grants to Rogers the non-exclusive license and right to distribute and exhibit in Canada (the \"Territory\") all entertainment programming to which Licensor owns or controls the VOD distribution and exhibition rights in the Territory (collectively, \"Licensed Programs\") to residential subscribers of Rogers' digital cable television service on a Video-on-Demand (\"VOD\") basis. For clarity, the VOD service that Rogers provides to such subscribers shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"ROD Service\".     2. LICENSED PROGRAMS.     (a) Subject to Section 3, Licensor shall forthwith provide to Rogers a comprehensive list (including title, length of program, license period and availability date) of all currently available Licensed Programs. During the Term, Licensor shall use best efforts to add newly available Licensed Programs to such list, and may periodically delete Licensed Programs from such list; provided, however, that: (i) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least ninety (90) days prior notice of the availability date of any Licensed Program added to such list during the Term; (ii) Licensor shall provide to Rogers at least sixty (60) days prior notice of the deletion of any Licensed Program from such list; and (iii) Licensor shall be responsible for any and all reasonable costs and/or losses incurred by Rogers as a result of any deletions from such list during the Term.     (b) Rogers reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine which Licensed Programs to distribute and exhibit on the ROD Service and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may decline to distribute or exhibit any Licensed Program that it determines, in its sole discretion, is unsuitable for distribution or exhibition on the ROD Service.     (c) Licensor shall use commercial reasonable efforts to provide Rogers with Licensed Programs with closed captioning.     3. AVAILABILITY DATE.

(c) Licensor shall not authorize the distribution or exhibition of any Licensed Program by any other means, including, without limitation, television (other than PPV) and internet, for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days following such Licensed Program's VOD availability date.     4.

(e) There shall be no minimum License Fee or retail viewing fee with respect to any Licensed Program. Additionally, Rogers shall not be required to pay any License Fees for VOD exhibitions of any Licensed Program occurring on or off premises that are made for the purposes of quality assurance or testing.
