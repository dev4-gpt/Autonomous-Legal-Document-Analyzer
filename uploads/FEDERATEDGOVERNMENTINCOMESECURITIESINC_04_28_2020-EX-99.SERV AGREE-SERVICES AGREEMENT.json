Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.\n\n4. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.\n\n(a) FASC shall not be responsible for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Advisor or any Account in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n(b) The Adviser shall indemnify FASC and shall hold FASC harmless from and against any liability to any Account or to any other person which may incurred by or asserted against FASC for any action taken or omitted by it in performing the Services in accordance with the above standards, and any expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) which may be incurred by FASC in investigating or defending itself against the assertion of any such liability. FASC shall give prompt notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice. The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, subject to the obligation of the Adviser to reimburse FASC for the expenses resulting therefrom. In the event Adviser gives notice that it will assume the defense of any claim, the Adviser shall not be obligated to indemnify FASC for any further legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending such claim, except those incurred at the request of the Adviser or its counsel. FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 30 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.\n\n(c) The Adviser and FASC are each hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of liability set forth in the Declaration of Trust of the other party. Each party agrees that the obligations of the other party pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited solely to such party and its assets, and neither party shall seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the shareholders, trustees, officers, employees or agents of the other party, or any of them.\n\n5.
