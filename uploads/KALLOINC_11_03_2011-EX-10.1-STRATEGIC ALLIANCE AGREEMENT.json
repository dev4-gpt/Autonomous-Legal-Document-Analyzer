Patient safety is among the most important goals of every healthcare provider, and participation in a variety of committees  and processes concerned with patient safety provides a way for biomedical managers and clinical engineering departments to gain  visibility and positively affect their workplace.     Kallo's Patient and Operator Safety Program uses a comprehensive software where in the actual work process within the Mobile  Care Clinic is monitored by the onsite Biomedical Technicians guided by the Senior Biomedical Engineers at Kallo Headquarters  qualified for managing the patient, staff, and environment safety to international standards.\n\n   The program covers all equipment in the Mobile Clinic. The local onsite Biomedical technicians will be the first response team to  attend to any and all breakdown calls from the Mobile Clinic. The Biomedical Technicians will then have Kallo Biomedical Engineer  support to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. After the breakdown service is carried out and the equipment is fixed and  recalibrated, the Senior Biomedical Engineers would then advise if a maintenance service has to be carried out to due to the nature of  breakdown.\n\n   The program covers all medical equipment in the Mobile Clinic. Kallos'  Certified Clinical Engineers / Biomedical Engineers and  Clinical Application support specialists will be available via Video/Teleconference/Telehealth systems in the Mobile clinic for all  clinical application support in using technology for diagnostic and therapeutic healthcare services. This is a critical component of the  program offered in order to make it successful in using technology at the front end which is normally neglected by all medical  equipment manufacturers' when the equipment is deployed in remote areas with medical staff who are not exposed to technology as  the case may be in urban areas, developed cites or countries.\n\n   This program helps avoid the likelihood of equipment-related risks, minimize liability of mishaps and incidents, and stay compliant with  regulatory reporting requirements.

Geographic Atrophy, Macular Degeneration, Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy and other conditions that can  affect vision may also be identified and monitored using FAF mode. Using invisible infrared alignment light, the digital non-mydriatic  camera may image patients with pupils as small as 3.3 mm (small pupil mode) without dilation drops. This is especially useful when  performing retinal screenings or expediting routine retinal imaging exams during office visits.  \n\n  KALLO - MOBILECARE\n\n\u2022 High Quality Images\u2028High resolution static images can be previewed within 3-5 seconds after exposure on a monitor  (optional). Images may be configured automatically with post-processing and are ready to be printed or transmitted through  the network using industry standard DICOM protocols.  \u2022 Full Patient Coverage End-to-end table coverage is available when the motorized tube column angulation is  combined with the motorized tube rotation. The motorized table adjusts the height, and the low minimum height simplifies  access for patients with mobility issues. When patients arrive at the radiology room on a trolley or in a bed, Smart Access  provides clear access to a 47 inch (120 cm) section of the table top to allow for a simplified transfer. The table loading  capacity accommodates patients weighing up to 500 lbs (230 kg).  \u2022 Auto-Positioning \u2028able movements, collimation and spectral filtration settings, exposure and digital acquisition  parameters may be administered with the single touch, remote-controlled user-interface reducing the preparation time needed  for exams.  \n\nPage 36\n\n\n\n\n\n    Features\n\n\n\n  KALLO - MOBILECARE\n\n\u2022Non-Mydriatic Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Photography\u2028Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) helps monitor macular  waste (e.g. lipofuscin) which can accumulate in the Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) layer. The accumulation of macular waste  can cause conditions such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) which can lead to reduced vision. The FAF mode  may be selected by pressing only one button.  \u2022Digital Filter Processing Red-Free and Cobalt digital filters are included and provide enhanced screening exams. Red-Free is  used for evaluating the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) and vascular structure of the retina associated with documenting  Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy or Hypertension. The Cobalt filter is also used for evaluating the RNFL, as well as Optic Disc  and Optic Disc Drusen. Additionally, Green (Vascular view) and Red channel (Choroid view) digital filter views are also  included.  \u2022Compact and Lightweight \u2028he small design of the CR-2 PLUS facilitates portability when needed using an optional hard shell  transport case sold separately. Canon instrument tables (sold separately) may comfortably fit both the camera and computer  workstation (sold separately). The space saving design also allows for use in limited office space environments.  \u2022Dedicated EOS Camera Technology \u2028Hgh quality diagnostic images are obtained using a dedicated camera for the CR-2  PLUS which incorporates a large, high-definition CMOS sensor with 18 megapixels. When the camera cover is removed, the  LCD may be adjusted to a variety of titled angles to suit the user's point of view.  \u2022Low Flash Intensity and ISO Sensitivity \u2028Th low flash intensity of the CR-2 PLUS minimizes miosis, thus shortening the  time required for taking multiple view exams or stereo images. The reduced brightness improves patient comfort and reduces  the \"ghost\" image the patient sees after an exposure. A wide range of low ISO speeds are supported including ISO 200, 400,  800, 1600, 3200 and 6400.  \u2022Automatic Exposure Function \u2028TheCR-2 PLUS measures the volume of infrared light from the retina and automatically  adjusts the flash intensity for observation and photography. This feature may be set to ON/OFF and can be adjusted using the  operation panel.  \u2022Control Panel \u2028The implified design of the control panel can be easily handled by an examiner. The one-handed joystick may  be used to position the camera to acquire the desired image. In darkly lit rooms, the operation panel illuminates for easier  navigation. The short main body of the CR-2 PLUS provides minimal distance between the patient and the operator allowing  easy access to adjust the patient's position or eyelids.  \u2022Retinal Imaging Control Software \u2028Usingthe Canon Retinal Imaging Control Software (RICS), images can be captured,  viewed, processed, printed and saved to a permanent storage database. The Canon RICS complies with the DICOM\u00ae*  Standard. Images may be stored as DICOM or JPEG files.
