Any Party (the \"Non-Breaching Party\") may terminate this Agreement with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the other Party (the \"Breaching Party\"), if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.6) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of 30 days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such service.

If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services.

Each Party hereto shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to protect the other Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise authorized in any other agreement between the Parties, any Party receiving any Confidential Information of the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") may use Confidential Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (the \"Permitted Purpose\"). Any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information only to its representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose and who have been advised of the terms of this Section 4.1 and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of these confidentiality provisions by such Persons; provided, however, that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the \"Disclosing Party\"), and take reasonable steps to assist in contesting such disclosure requirement or in protecting the Disclosing Party's rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its counsel in writing that it is legally bound to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information. 4.2 Return of Confidential Information. Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party's option, all Confidential Information received in connection with this Agreement.
