It also provides an \"effort level\" quantity that indicates the level of effort of the caller. The functional and performance requirements are specified to cover a wide range of applications, such as voice activated recordings (as in voice messaging), outbound call classification, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and voice conferencing.\n\n1.       The Voice Activity Detector classifies every block of voice data (8 ms          long) as \"port active\" (early detect), \"speaker active\" (port          sustained), and \"not active\".\n\n2.       It provides a measurement that approximates the level of effort exerted          by the caller. Such an approximation is made by normalizing the short          term RMS of the voice signal by a longer term RMS value. The \"effort          level\" varies between -32 dB and 31 dB, and is at 0 dB when the speaker          is speaking at his/her \"normal\" level.\n\n3.       The Voice Activity Detector adapts to background noise up to -24 dBm.          Adaptation is 200 ms when the noise level drops, and is approximately          1000 ms when noise rises.\n\n4.       The Voice Activity Detector screens out sidetone or echo as speech up          to an ERL of -26 dB.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL    21\n\nA.2.2    Performance Requirements:\n\nThe accuracy of the voice Activity detector is measured by the rate of \"false detection\" (i.e. classifying noise or echo as voice activity) and \"clipping\" (i.e. classifying voice activity as noise or echo) under different ambient noise and echo conditions. \"Port active\" detection under different ambient noise conditions:\n\n1.       No perceptible clipping at quiet to modest noise levels of -50 dBm to          -40 dBm with nominal levels of speech activity (-20 dBm average power          over 2 seconds of speech). No more than 5% of voice onsets is clipped          for noisy conditions (noise level from -40 dBm to -30 dBm).\n\n2.       No more than 1% of \"silence\" periods is detected as speech for the          modest noise condition. No more than 2% of \"silence\" is detected as          port active for noisy conditions.\n\n3.       The performance goals above is met when noise levels change during the          test.\n\n\"Speaker active\" detection under different ambient noise conditions:\n\n1.       Speech activity that lasts more than tSUSTAIN is detected as          \"Sustained\" or \"Speaker Active\".\n\n2.       The clipping requirements is better than \"Port Activity\" detection.          Fewer than 0.5% of onsets/hour (2.5 per hour) for modest noise          condition (-45 dBm) and fewer than 2% (10 per hour) for high noise          condition (-35 dBm) have perceptible clipping.\n\n3.       False detection performance (i.e., detecting noise as \"speaker active\")          exceeds those of \"port activity\" due to tSUSTAIN criteria. No more than          1% (36 seconds per hour) of noise segments is misclassified as          \"sustained\" for modest noise conditions, and no more than 2% (72          seconds per hour) of \"silence\" is detected as port active for noisy          conditions.\n\n\"Port active\" and \"Speaker active\" detection in the presence of echo:\n\n1.       Less than 1% of residual echo is detected as \"port active\" - (i.e. 36          sec. per hour) during normal operation of canceller.\n\n2.       Less than 0.1 % (i.e. 3.6 sec per hour) of residual echo is detected as          \"speaker active\" or \"port sustained\" during normal operation of          canceller.\n\n3.       Clipping of input speech in the presence of echo is no higher than          clipping in the presence of modest to high level of noise.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n22\n\nA.3      DTMF Detection\n\nA.3.1    Functional requirements:\n\nTable A-1 specifies the nominal frequencies for the DTMF digits that must be detected.\n\n      --------------------------------------------------------------                                     Nominal High Group Frequencies (Hz)                                     1209      1336       1477      1633          --------------------------------------------------------------            Nominal        697        1         2          3         A\n\n\n\n\n\n       Low Group       770        4         5          6         B          Frequencies      852        7         8          9         C             (Hz)          941        *         0          #         D          --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Table A-1: Nominal DTMF Frequencies\n\n1.

DTMF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is          met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the          earliest possible response to the digit, such as stopping voice output.\n\n3.       The trailing edge of a DTMF digit must be detected. This allows the          system to delay any response (such as playing out voice) to the digit          until the user has released the DTMF key. The criteria selected for          trailing edge detection will debounce DTMF digits.\n\n4.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they          are detected.

Talk-down: DTMF detection must work reliably in the presence of echo          (for the maximum allowable output voice level) and with varying levels          of DTMF signals (due to network loss). D2's DTMF detector combined with          the echo must meet the performance requirements of Figure A-I in the          presence echo generated by playing pause-removed voice (male and          female) at - 18 dBm ASL (averaged over 3 seconds) over a telephone          circuit with 15 dB echo return loss (ERL).\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\n                Figure A-1: DTMF Talk-down Acceptance Curve\n\n3.       Debounce test: Long tones (generated by \"hard\" key presses) must not be          detected as multiple tones in the presence of echo interference or line          noise. Combined with the echo canceller, the DTMF detector is required          to reliably \"debounce\" all DTMF digits above -18 dBm in the presence of          voice levels below -15 dBm (ASL) and a telephone circuit with echo          return loss (ERL) of 15 dB.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n25\n\n4.       Double-talk talk-off: Many voice processing hardware or semiconductor          manufacturers significantly degrade the \"talk-off' performance of their          detector in the presence of voice echo or sidetone to achieve a high          level of talk-down performance. This strategy is acceptable in a pure          digit-in-voice-out scenario, but for voice conferencing or voice          recognition applications, voice could be present in the both the          transmit and receive path. In such cases, the DTMF detector must be          very robust against \"talk-off\" in double-talk situations. The talk-off          requirements for D2's DTMF detector under double-talk is fewer than 66          talkoffs for the Bellcore talk-off tape.\n\nA.4      Tone Generation\n\nThe tone generation module can be programmed to generate any single, dual or amplitude modulated tone required to meet international telecommunications specifications. This functionality is provided by the GENF module, which produces the sum or product of two independently generated sine waves as its output. Each sine wave can be individually parameterized.\n\nA.4.l    Functional requirements:\n\nThe GENF module is designed to generate a wide range of DTMF, Call Progress Signals, MF Rl/R2, and miscellaneous tones. In order to meet or exceed international telecommunication specifications, GENF must meet or exceed the following functional requirements.\n\n1.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for each frequency for dual          tones that GENF generates. Single tones are generated by specifying          that one of the dual tone's frequencies is 0 Hz.\n\n2.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for the carrier and modulation          frequencies for amplitude modulated tones that GENF generates.\n\n3.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the frequency of a tone to be          set in the range of 0 to 4000 Hz in 1 Hz units.\n\n4.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the output power to be set in          the range of +3 to -50 dBm in 0.5 dB steps.\n\n5.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow an amplitude modulated tone's          modulation percentage to be set in the range of 0 to 300% in 1% units.\n\n6.       The tone duration (make time) shall be specified in 1 ms units. Tone          durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to 8191 ms.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n7.       An unlimited tone duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1.\n\n8.       The silence duration between tones (break time) shall be specified in 1          ms units. Silence durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to          8191 ms.\n\n9.       An unlimited silence duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1 and setting both frequencies of a dual tone to 0 Hz.\n\n10.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          EIA/TIA-464 requirement for DTMF and call progress tone generation.\n\n11.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          CCITT Blue Book Volume VI Fascicle VI.4 recommendations Q.310-Q.490          requirements for MF R1 and R2 tone generation.\n\n12.      The GENF module shall generate tones with one to three unique cadence          pairs (on/off pairs).\n\nA.4.2    Performance Requirements\n\n1.       Frequency accuracy shall exceed 1 Hz. 2.       Level accuracy shall exceed 0.5 dB. 3.       Timing information shall exceed 1 ms accuracy.\n\nA.5      Universal Tone Detector\n\nA.5.l    Overview\n\nThe Universal Tone Detector (UTD) is a high configurable tone detector. By changing parameters, this algorithm can classify a wide range of single and dual tone call progress signals generated in a wide variety of countries.\n\nA.5.2    General\n\nSince different tones need different detection heuristics, and tones may have multiple specifications, each tone is tagged with a tone category identifier.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n27\n\n               -----------------------------------------------                   Tone Category             Call Progress Signal                   -----------------------------------------------                          1                  Modem                          2                  FAX CNG                          3                  Audible Ringback                          4                  Busy                          5                  Reorder or Congestion                          6                  Number Unobtainable                          7                  SIT                          8                  Dial tone                          9                  Unknown Tone                   -----------------------------------------------\n\n                        Table A-3: Tone Categories\n\nIn addition to specifying a tone category, the parameters include a value that is returned to the application when the tone is detected. This parameter need not be unique. This allows multiple specifications to report the same tone event to the application. UTD is table driven. Using this approach, the tone detector searches parameter tables for a matching tone. When a tone matches, the tone code determines the heuristics necessary to completely classify the tone. Also, the tones must be specified in a way that a set of parameters corresponds to either a single tone, a dual tone, or an amplitude modulated tone.\n\n                     ---------------------------------                         Code               Tone Type                         ---------------------------------                          0                 Single Tone                          1                 Dual Tone                          2                 Modulated Tone                         ---------------------------------\n\n                    Table A-4: Call Progress Tone Types\n\nA.5.3    General Functional Requirements\n\nUTD functionally combines a single tone detector and a dual/modulated tone detector into a single module. UTD combines the results of these detectors into a single result. UTD has the following requirements.\n\n1.       The DSP shall indicate that the first ringback has started after at          least 400 ms of ringback like signal has been processed, as long as no          other tone type is early detected. If more than one type of tone is          early detected, the first ringback reporting shall be delayed until          either cadence information disqualifies the other types, or tone          precedence is used as a 'tie-breaker'.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n28\n\n2.       The DSP shall indicate ringback has stopped when ringback is no longer          detected.\n\n3.       The DSP shall indicate a busy tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n4.       The DSP shall indicate a reorder tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n5.       The DSP shall indicate a number unobtainable tone has been detected          after the requisite number of make and break intervals have been          processed, and no other tone category is still a candidate for          detection.\n\n6.       In the event that more than one tone is a candidate for detection,          detection is delayed until all characteristics that may disqualify any          of the candidates are tested (for example, waiting for multiple cadence          pairs to occur). If there is still more than one potential tone after          all differentiating features have been exhausted, then the tone with          the highest precedence is detected. Also, if the tone ceases prior to          singling out one candidate tone, then the tone with the highest          precedence is detected. Precedence is shown in Table A-3.\n\n7.       The DSP shall supply an early detect flag. This flag shall be valid          after the detector has processed no more than 72 ms of a tone. If more          than one tone category is early detected, then the early detect flag          shall indicate the tone category with the highest precedence.\n\n8.       The DSP shall indicate that a modem has been detected if a single tone          falls within the specified frequencies for modem tones, the minimum          make interval has been exceeded while the average tone power is in          excess of the minimum power requirement, and no other tone category is          still a candidate for detection.\n\n9.       The DSP shall indicate that a FAX CNG tone has been detected if a          single tone falls within the specified frequencies for a CNG tone, the          requisite number of on/off cadences have been processed, and no other          tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n10.      The DSP shall indicate that a SIT tone has been detected if at least          two of the three segments of possible SIT tones have been detected for          at least the minimum interval in excess of the minimum power          requirement.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n29\n\n11.      The DSP shall indicate that an Unknown tone has been detected when it          has been determined that a tone has been detected that falls within the          specified frequencies for an Unknown tone, the minimum duration has          been exceeded, and the tone does not match and other category tones.\n\nA.5.3.1 TONE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS\n\nA.5.3.1.1 Single Tones\n\nThere are four types of parameters that shall be used to control single tone detection. The variation of each parameter shall be limited by the constraints listed in Table A-5.\n\n                                      ------------------------------                                          Minimum             Maximum          --------------------------------------------------------------          Frequency                       300 Hz              3300 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Bandwidth                       0 Hz                1800 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Duration                        100 msec            32760 msec          --------------------------------------------------------------          Minimum Power Level             -45 dBm             3 dBm          --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Table A-5: Single Tone Detection Constraints\n\nThe frequency detection range shall be specified the Frequency and Bandwidth parameters. Figure A-2 shows the relationship of these parameters. Note that the bandwidth specification is symmetric about the center frequency. The Frequency and Bandwidth parameters define a \"must detect\" range. The detector shall not use frequency criteria to reject any tones which are within the range specified Frequency/Bandwidth parameters. Tones whose frequencies are outside but close to frequency range may be detected.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\nFigure A-2: Frequency Domain Representation of tone parameters for a             Single Tone\n\nIf the Power Level of the detected parameter is greater than the minimum power specified by the parameters, the signal shall not be rejected by Power Level heuristics. Duration parameters are used to set the allowable duration of a tone. Minimum and maximum tone durations may be specified (make durations). Also, minimum and maximum silence durations between tones may be specified.\n\nA.5.3.1.2         Dual Tones\n\nDual tones are created by summing two sinusoids. Since each tone can be isolated in the frequency domain, dual tones are specified as a pair of single tones. Parameters for each tone of a dual pair use the same constraints as single tones. Namely, frequency1 is the center frequency of the lower tone, and bandwidth1 specifies its frequency tolerance. The same is true for frequency2 and bandwidth2 for the high tone. Figure A-3 shows the definition of the frequency and bandwidth parameters for a dual tone.\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\nFigure A-3: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters for a Dual Tone\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n31\n\nNot all dual tones are detectable by UTD. A dual tone shall detected only when the difference between the two component frequencies is greater than 10 Hz and less than 230Hz.\n\nA.5.3.1.3         Amplitude Modulated Tones\n\nAmplitude modulated tones are created by multiplying two sinusoids. When analyzed in the frequency domain, a modulated tone looks like three tones. Figure A-4 shows the frequency spectrum for a modulated tone.\n\nThe tone whose frequency is the average of the other tones is the carrier. The other two tones can be referred to as side lobes. For amplitude modulated tones, frequencyl and bandwidth1 specify the low sidelobe and its tolerance, while frequency2 and bandwidth2 specify the high sidelobe and its tolerance.\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\n      Figure A-4: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters                          for an Amplitude Modulated Tone\n\nAs with dual tones, not all modulated tones will be detected by UTD. Modulated tones shall be detected if the difference between the carrier frequency and the sidelobes is between 10 Hz and 230 Hz.\n\nA.5.3.l.4         Precedence\n\nBy assigning a detection precedence to the classification process, tone frequency ranges can overlap. When a tone's parameters fall into a range shared by two or more signals, the signal is classified as the one with the highest precedence.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n32\n\n               -------------------------------------------                   Precedence            Call Progress Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n               -------------------------------------------                       1                 Modem                       2                 FAX CNG                       3                 Audible Ringback                       4                 Busy                       5                 Reorder or Congestion                       6                 Number Unobtainable                       7                 SIT                       8                 Dial Tone                       9                 Unknown Tone                   -------------------------------------------\n\n                   Table A-6: Tone Detection Precedence\n\nTable A-6 shows the precedence of typical tones that the UTD module detects. Modem signals have the highest precedence, and Unknown tones have the lowest. Therefore, the frequency range of unknown tones can safely overlap the other tone ranges without causing tones to be misclassified. If the range for Unknown tones is allowed to be the maximum range allowed by the detector, any detected tone that is unclassified would be designated as Unknown.\n\nA.5.3.1.5         North American Call Progress Signal Detection\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n\nThe tables below specify the frequencies, power levels, and cadence of the Bellcore and EIA-464A call progress tones.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         Frequency (Hz)                 Power Level (dBm) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Name         350     440     480     620     Per Frequency        Combined - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audible Ring              X       X               -22.5 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Busy                          X       X        -27 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Dial Tone       X       X                       -17.5 to  -15     -13 to -14.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Intercept               X               X        -20 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Reorder                        X       X        -27 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Table A-7: Call Progress Tone Frequency and Power Requirements\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n33\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audible ring (ring-       repetition of the tone on for 0.8 to 2.2 seconds, and  back)                     off for 2.7 to 4.4 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Busy                      repetition of the tone on for 0.5+/-0.05 seconds, and                            off for 0.5 +/-0.05 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dial                      steady uninterrupted - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intercept                 repetition of an alternating sequence, of the two                           frequencies each being on for 0.16 to 0.30 seconds                           with a total cycle time of 0.5 +/-0.05 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reorder (fast busy)       repetition of the tone on for 0.25+/-0.025 seconds,                            and off for 0.25+/-0.025 seconds - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                   Table A-8: Call Progress Tone Cadence\n\nPerformance Requirements:\n\n1.

A SIT tone sequence generally precedes a recorded voice announcement such as \"the number you have dialed is no longer in service...\" and is provided specifically for the purpose of detection of the problem type by an automated device.\n\nThere are two popular types of SIT sequences. The first type is used mainly in Europe. It consists of a sequence of three tones of identical durations. The second type is the one used in North America. There are several North American SIT sequences that are encoded using various combinations of frequency and duration for each of the three tones. The encoding has been standardized by Bellcore.\n\nPerformance Requirements:\n\n1.       The UTD shall handle both types of sequences.\n\n2.       There is no talkdown performance requirement. The near end is always          silent and does not interfere with far end SIT signals.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n37\n\n3.       There shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 5 hours of voice when the          detector is programmed with the recommended parameters. Assuming that          each voice call is has an average of 2 seconds of voice, there shall be          fewer than 1 talkoff in 9000 calls.\n\nA.5.3.1.9         Unknown Tone\n\nAny single tone, dual tone, amplitude modulated tone or single tone sequence that is not classified as a CP, SIT, CNG or modem ANS tone, shall be reported as an unknown tone.\n\nPerformance Requirements:\n\n1.       Talkdown performance requirement [TBD]\n\n2.       There shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 5 hours of voice when the          detector is programmed with the recommended parameters (minimum tone          duration 400 ms). Assuming that each voice call is has an average of 2          seconds of voice, there shall be fewer than 1 talkoff in 9000 calls.\n\nA.6      Multifrequency Tone Detection (MFD)\n\nThe MFD algorithm module detects the presence of Rl, R2 Forward, and R2 Backward Multi frequency (MF) tones under a broad range of network conditions and under international telecommunications specifications.\n\nA.6.1    Functional requirements:\n\nTable A-10, Table A-11, and Table A-12 specify the nominal frequencies for the MF digits that must be detected.\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- F1 (Hz)                             F2 (Hz)\n\n\n\n\n\n           900         1100        1300        1500        1700                -------------------------------------------------------------   700          1            2           4           7         Spare       900         --            3           5           8         Spare      1100         --           --           6           9          KP        1300         --           --          --           0         Spare      1500         --           --          --          --          ST       - -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                         Table A-10: Nominal MF R1 Frequencies and corresponding digit definitions\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n38\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- F1 (Hz)                             F2 (Hz)              1500         1620        1740        1860       1980           -------------------------------------------------------------  1380          1            2           4           7         11  1500         --            3           5           8         12  1620         --           --           6           9         13  1740         --           --          --          10         14  1860         --           --          --          --         15 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable A-11: Nominal MF R2 Forward Frequencies and corresponding combination                                      numbers\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- F1 (Hz)                             F2 (Hz)              1020          900         780         660        540           -------------------------------------------------------------  1140          1            2           4           7         11  1020         --            3           5           8         12   900         --           --           6           9         13   780         --           --          --          10         14   660         --           --          --          --         15 - -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTable A-12: Nominal MF R2 Backward Frequencies and corresponding combination                                      numbers\n\n1.       Be configurable to detect either R1, R2 forward, or R2 backward MF          digits on a per-call basis.\n\n2.       Detect the presence of all 15 R1, 15 R2 Forward, and 15 R2 Backward          digits under a broad range of network conditions.\n\n3.       MF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is          met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the          earliest possible response to the digit, such as in compelled          signaling.\n\n4.       The trailing edge of a MF digit must be detected. This allows the          system to delay any response (such as in compelled signaling) to the          digit until it is removed. The criteria selected for trailing edge          detection will debounce MF digits.\n\n5.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they          are detected. MF events are not buffered.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n39\n\nA.6.2 R1 Detection Performance requirements:\n\nTable A- 13 consists of MF R1 tone detection performance requirements taken from CCITT/ITU Q310-Q331 and Bellcore TR-NWT-000506.
