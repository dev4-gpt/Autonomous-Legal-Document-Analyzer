COMMENCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT\n\n1.1 This Agreement shall take effect 26  September 2019 (the \"Effective Date\").\n\n1.2 Your employment shall commence on 26  September 2019 and shall continue unless and until either party gives notice to the other in accordance with paragraph 11 below. No employment with a previous employer is deemed to be continuous with your employment with the Company.\n\n1.3 You warrant that by entering into this Agreement or any other arrangements with the Company you will not be in breach of or subject to any express or implied terms of any contract with, or other obligation to, any third party binding on you, including, without limitation, any notice period or the provisions of any restrictive covenants or confidentiality obligations arising out of any employment with any other employer or former employer.\n\n1.4 You warrant that you have the right to work in the United Kingdom and you agree to provide to the Company copies of all relevant documents in this respect at the request of the Company. If at any time during the course of this Agreement you cease to have the right to work in the United Kingdom the Company may immediately terminate your employment without payment of compensation.\n\n2. JOB TITLE\n\n2.1 You shall serve as Chief Business Officer (\"CBO\") reporting to the CEO. The nature of the Company's business may result in changes occurring to the content of your role from time to time. You may also be required to carry out such additional or alternative tasks as may from time to time be reasonably required of you consistent with your executive level and job title, provided that these do not fundamentally change or undermine your position.\n\n2.2 You shall faithfully and diligently perform such duties as you are required to undertake from time to time and exclusively devote the whole of your working time, skills, ability and attention to the business of the Company and use your best endeavours to promote the interests and reputation of the Company and (where applicable) any Group Company.\n\n2.3 The Company may require you to carry out work for, or become a director or officer of, any Group Company at any time.\n\n3. PLACE OF WORK\n\nThe Company's offices at Building 900, Babraham Research Campus, Babraham, Cambridge,\n\n1\n\nth\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\nUK or such other location as the Company may reasonably determine. The CBO position may require extensive international travel on business.\n\n4. REMUNERATION\n\n4.1 Your salary will be USD370,000 per annum paid monthly in arrears on or about the last working day of each month (less statutory and voluntary deductions) (\"Salary\"). Salary will be converted to GBP and paid in GBP based on the USD/GBP Bank of England daily spot exchange rate applicable on the date of this Agreement, with the exchange rate being revised according to the prevailing Bank of England daily spot exchange rate applicable on 1 January of each year. Your Salary will be reviewed annually in accordance with the Company's practices from time to time (which is expected to be by the end of the first quarter of each year). You will be notified in writing of any changes to your Salary or benefits.\n\n4.2 You agree that the Company may deduct from the Salary or any other sum due to you (including any pay in lieu of notice) any amounts due to the Company including, without limitation, any overpayment of salary, loan or advance.\n\n4.3 For the purposes of this Agreement your earned salary shall mean the proportion of your Salary earned by and due to you in each calendar year of employment with the Company (\"Earned Salary\").\n\n4.4 Annual Performance Bonuses:\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual performance related bonus scheme to a maximum value of 35% of your Earned Salary in relation to your performance against agreed annual corporate and personal performance objectives as set out below (the \"Annual Performance Bonus\"). That is, if the compensation committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL's share option plan rules), with due consideration for the operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.\n\nAny Annual Performance Bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National Insurance deductions. Performance will be assessed by the Compensation Committee at the end of each calendar year, against annual corporate and personal performance objectives agreed between you and the Board at the start of each calendar year, with any such bonus being payable in the first quarter of the following year. Qualification for your Annual Performance Bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of your employment to the Company) on 31 December of the year to which your bonus entitlement applies.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Equity Incentives\n\nBTL has established the Bicycle Therapeutics 2019 Share Option Plan (the \"Option Plan\").\n\nOn or as soon as practicable following the Effective Date, it is intended that you will be granted an option under the Option Plan to acquire 107,417 ordinary shares in the capital of BTL (\"Shares\") (representing approximately 0.6% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date).\n\nIn addition, and conditional on completion of a transaction on terms set out below, you will be granted a second option under the Option Plan, such option being one of:\n\n(a) an option to acquire 44,757 Shares (representing approximately 0.25% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment of at least USD30,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of at least USD300,000,000; or\n\n(b) an option to acquire 22,378 Shares (representing approximately 0.125% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment of USD24,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of USD240,000,000; or\n\n(c) an option to acquire such number of Shares (falling between 0.125% and 0.25% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date as the Board shall determine in its absolute discretion) granted as soon as practicable following completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment greater than USD24,000,000 but less than USD 30,000,000, and per product downstream milestone payments greater than USD240,000,000 but less than USD 300,000,000.\n\nAny options granted under this paragraph 4.5 shall be subject to (i) the approval of the Board and/or the Compensation Committee; (ii) the rules of the Option Plan (as amended from time to time); and (iii) the terms of the option grant documentation which will be provided to you following such grant.\n\n5 BENEFITS\n\n5.1 The Company currently operates a personal pension plan provided by Scottish Widows Group. The Company will pay a sum equivalent to 12 % of your basic annual earned salary into a personal pension plan selected by the Company. You may make additional contributions if you wish, but this is not mandatory. In the event that you elect, of your own volition, to opt-out of the Company's pension scheme then the Company will pay you in equal monthly instalments in arrears (less statutory deductions) a sum equivalent to the contribution that it would have made into your pension scheme (the \"Cash Equivalent Payment\") less the Employer's National Insurance Contribution cost incurred by the Company as a result of making the Cash Equivalent Payment.\n\n5.2 The Company currently operates a private healthcare scheme and subject to acceptance by the insurer on reasonable terms, you will be entitled to join.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 The Company operates a death in service scheme which you automatically join upon commencement of employment.\n\n5.4 Further details regarding benefits will be provided upon commencement of your employment. The Company reserves the right to replace or supplement any or all of the scheme(s) referred to in this paragraph 5, or to amend them at any time without compensation, provided that equivalent scheme(s) providing a similar level of benefit are put in place.\n\n6 EXPENSES\n\nThe Company shall reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses properly incurred by you in the performance of the duties under this Agreement including travelling, subsistence and entertainment expenses provided you follow the Company's guidelines/allowances in force at the relevant time and provided that you shall, where reasonably practicable, provide the Company with vouchers, invoices or such other evidence of such expenses as the Company may reasonably require.\n\n7 HOURS OF WORK\n\n7.1 Your normal working hours are Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 5.30 pm on each working day with one hour for lunch. You will be required to work such other hours as shall be reasonably necessary for you to perform your duties for which no further remuneration is payable.\n\n7.2 By entering into this Agreement you confirm, that in your capacity as Chief Business Officer you may choose or determine the duration of your working time and the working time limits set out in part II of the Working Time Regulations 1998 do not apply to you.\n\n8 HOLIDAYS\n\n8.1 In addition to the usual public holidays you will be entitled to 25 working days paid holiday in each calendar year. The holiday will accrue on a pro rata basis throughout each calendar year.\n\n8.2 Holidays may only be taken at such time or times as are approved beforehand by the CEO, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. You must give reasonable notice of proposed holiday dates by e-mailing the CEO or delegated director in advance, for approval.\n\n8.3 The holiday year runs from January to December. With the agreement of the CEO, you may carry forward up to 5 days of untaken holiday into the next holiday year. Any carried over holiday must be taken by the end of March of the following calendar year or will be forfeited and no payment will be made in respect of any days so forfeited. You will not generally be permitted to take more than 10 days holiday at any one time.\n\n8.4 Upon termination of your employment you will receive pay in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday. The Company may deduct an appropriate sum in respect of days taken in excess of your pro rata entitlement from your final remuneration on the basis that one day's holiday will be calculated as 1/260ths of your basic annual salary.\n\n8.5 In the event that notice of termination of this Agreement is served by either party, the Company may require you to take any outstanding holiday during this notice period.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n9 SICKNESS AND OTHER ABSENCE\n\n9.1 If you are unable to attend at work by reason of sickness or injury or any unauthorised reason you must inform the Company as soon as possible on the first day of absence (and in any event not later than 11.00 am on the first day of absence) and, in the case of absence of uncertain duration, you must keep the Company regularly informed of your continued absence and your likely date of return. You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the Company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the Company.\n\n9.2 If your absence, due to sickness or injury, is for less than seven (7) days, on your return to work you are required to immediately complete a self-certification form available from the Company. If your absence continues for more than seven (7) consecutive days (whether or not working days) you must provide the Company with a doctor's certificate from the seventh consecutive day of sickness or injury. This doctor's certificate must be provided to the Company promptly following the seventh consecutive day of absence. If illness continues after the expiry of the first certificate, further certificates must be provided promptly to cover the whole period of absence.\n\n9.3 Subject to your compliance with the Company's sickness absence procedures (as amended from time to time), the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion pay full salary and contractual benefits during any period of absence due to sickness or injury for up to an aggregate of 3 months in any fifty-two (52) week period (whether such absence is continuous or intermittent in any calendar year). Such payment shall be inclusive of any statutory sick pay due in accordance with applicable legislation in force at the time of absence. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so justify. Thereafter, the Company shall pay statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be entitled subject to your compliance with the appropriate rules.\n\n9.4 Whether absent from work or not, you may be, but only on reasonable grounds, required to undergo a medical examination by a Company doctor and your consent will be sought for a report to be sent to the Company.\n\n9.5 The payment of sick pay in accordance with this paragraph 9 is without prejudice to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement prior to the expiry of your right to payments.\n\n9.6 In the event you are incapable of performing your duties by reason of injuries sustained wholly or partly as a result of a third party's actions all payments made to you by the Company as salary or sick pay shall to the extent that compensation is recoverable from that third party constitute loans to you and shall be due and owing when and to the extent that you recover compensation for loss of earnings from the third party.\n\n10 GARDEN LEAVE\n\n10.1 After notice of termination has been given by you or the Company, the Company may at its discretion require you, for all or part of your notice period, to comply with any or all of the following instructions:\n\n(a) not to carry out any further work for the Company or for any Group Company;\n\n(b) to remain away from the Company's business premises and those of any Group\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany (unless given written permission to do otherwise);\n\n(c) not to contact any of the Company's clients, suppliers or employees or those of any Group Company without the Company's prior written permission;\n\n(d) to carry out only part of your duties, or to carry out alternative duties or special projects for the Company within your skill set;\n\n(e) to co-operate in the handover of your duties and responsibilities;\n\n(f) to resign from any offices (including as a director) you hold within the Company or any Group Company or by virtue of your employment with us;\n\n(g) to answer, in an honest and helpful way, such questions as the Company may reasonably ask of you;\n\n(h) to keep the Company informed of your whereabouts and contact details and to remain reasonably contactable and available for work.\n\n10.2 During any such period as described in paragraph 10.1 (\"Garden Leave\") the Company may appoint another person to carry out some or all of your duties. You will continue to owe all other duties and obligations (whether express or implied including fidelity and good faith) during Garden Leave and you shall continue to receive full pay and benefits (except that you will not accrue any further entitlement to any cash or equity incentive awards or bonus payments in respect of the Garden Leave period).\n\n10.3 By placing you on Garden Leave, the Company will not be in breach of this Agreement or any implied duty of any kind whatsoever nor will you have any claim against the Company in respect of any such action.\n\n10.4 During any period of Garden Leave you will remain readily contactable and available for work save when on paid holiday taken in accordance with paragraph 8. In the event that you are not available for work having been requested by the Company to do so, you will, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, forfeit any right to salary and contractual benefits.\n\n10.5 During any period of Garden Leave the Company may require you to deliver up any Confidential Information or property of the Company or any Group Company and upon instruction, delete any emails, spreadsheets or other Confidential Information and you will confirm your compliance with this paragraph 10.5 in writing if requested to do so by the Company.\n\n10.6 During any period of Garden Leave the Company may require you to take any outstanding holiday entitlement.\n\n11 NOTICE\n\n11.1 Without prejudice to the Company's right to summarily terminate your employment in accordance with paragraph 11.3 below and your right to summarily terminate your employment for Good Reason in accordance with paragraph 11.4 below, either you or the Company may terminate your employment by giving to the other not less than six months' notice in writing.\n\n11.2 The Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to give written notice to\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nterminate your employment forthwith and to make a payment to you in lieu of salary and the benefits set out in paragraph 5 of this Agreement for all or any unexpired part of the notice period. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment in lieu made pursuant to this paragraph 11.2 will not include any element in relation to any payment in respect of (i) any Annual Performance Bonus or (ii) any holiday entitlement that would have otherwise accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made. For the further avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to make a Payment in Lieu after notice of termination has been given by you, this will not constitute a termination by the Company without Cause for the purposes of paragraphs 11.7 and 11.8 below.\n\n11.3 The Company may summarily terminate your employment hereunder (without notice) for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Cause\" shall mean where you:\n\n(a) commit gross misconduct which includes, but is not limited to, dishonesty, fraud, theft, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work, causing actual or threatening physical harm and causing damage to Company property;\n\n(b) commit a material breach or non-observance of your duties or any of the provisions of this Agreement, or materially fail to observe the lawful directions of the Company, or breach any material Company policy or code of conduct, including but not limited to the Company's policy from time to time on matters relating to harassment;\n\n(c) are convicted of a criminal offence (other than an offence under the road traffic legislation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere for which a non-custodial sentence is imposed);\n\n(d) act in a manner which in the reasonable opinion of the Company, brings the Company into disrepute or otherwise prejudices or is in the reasonable opinion of the Company considered likely to prejudice the reputation of the Company;\n\n(e) in the reasonable opinion of the Company, are guilty of any serious negligence in connection with or affecting the business or affairs of the Company;\n\n(f) are unfit to carry out the duties hereunder because of sickness, injury or otherwise for an aggregate period of 26 weeks in any fifty-two (52) week period even if, as a result of such termination, you would or might forfeit any entitlement to benefit from sick pay under paragraph 9.3 above.\n\nAny delay or forbearance by the Company in exercising any right of termination in accordance with this paragraph 11.3 will not constitute a waiver of such right.\n\n11.4 You may summarily terminate your employment hereunder at any time (without notice) for Good Reason after complying with the Good Reason Process. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Good Reason\" shall mean that you have complied with the \"Good Reason Process\" (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a material diminution in your responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in your Salary; (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which you provides services to the Company; or (iv) the material breach of this Agreement by the Company. \"Good Reason Process\" shall mean that (i) you reasonably determine in good faith that a \"Good Reason\" condition has occurred; (ii) you notify the Company in writing of the first occurrence of the Good\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nReason condition within 60 days of the first occurrence of such condition; (iii) you cooperate in good faith with the Company's efforts, for a period not less than 30 days following such notice (the \"Cure Period\"), to remedy the condition; (iv) notwithstanding such efforts, the Good Reason condition continues to exist; and (v) you terminate your employment (without notice) within 60 days after the end of the Cure Period.

In addition, subject to (i) your (or your authorised representative or estate signing, if the termination is due to your death) signing a settlement agreement and a separation agreement and release (together the \"Settlement Agreements\") in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, which shall include, without limitation, a general release of claims against the Company and all related persons and entities, a reaffirmation of all of your continuing obligations to the Company, including those set forth in paragraphs 13 - 15, and (in the case of the separation agreement and release) and a seven (7) business day revocation period; and (ii) the separation agreement and release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the Termination Date (or such shorter period as set forth in the Settlement Agreements), the Company shall: (A) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to nine (9) months of your salary as of the Termination Date (which payment shall not be reduced by either the value of any salary paid to you during your notice period or by any payment in lieu of notice made pursuant to paragraph 11.2); and (B) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing you with the contractual benefits under paragraph 5 for nine (9) months or, at the Company's option, continue to provide you with such benefits for nine (9) months.\n\nSeverance Pay and Benefits Upon Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason Within the Change in Control Period\n\n11.8 The provisions of this paragraph 11.8 shall apply in lieu of, and expressly supersede, the provisions of paragraph 11.7 regarding severance pay and benefits upon a termination by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason if such termination of employment occurs within 12 months after the occurrence of the first event constituting a Change in Control (such period, the \"Change in Control Period\").
