(\"Jasper\") in [***];\n\nWHEREAS, Premier is the owner of certain proprietary formulations, manufacturing processes and techniques and wishes to have Product manufactured and packaged by Heritage in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: 1.

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCT\n\n(a) Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the \"Products\"), for Premier at [***] Heritage's or Heritage's wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper's, [***] (the \"Facilities\"). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage's [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier's facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.\n\n(b) Heritage and Premier agree that all Products subject to this Agreement, and their current and subsequently modified respective formulas are confidential and proprietary, and the sole property of Premier unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.\n\n(c) Minimum Annual Order Volume. During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2017, and for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] Units (the twelve-month periods and the six month period are each a \"Contract Period\").\n\n(d) During the Term, Premier shall have the right (but not the obligation) to order from Heritage quantities of Products in excess of [***] and provided Heritage has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities of Products, Heritage agrees to produce such additional quantities per the pricing and terms on Schedule C.\n\n(e) [***]\n\n(f) [***]\n\n(g) Within [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Premier shall provide to Heritage a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth Premier's non-binding good faith estimated purchases (each, a \"Forecast\") for the [***] period commencing on the date thereof (the \"Forecast Delivery Date\"). Each Forecast shall also designate which Facility shall manufacture the Products set forth in such Forecast (i.e. Heritage's [***] Facility, Jasper's [***] Facility, or some other facility agreed to by the Parties). Heritage shall notify Premier, in writing (or email), within [***] of each Forecast Delivery Date, if Heritage's or Jasper's Facilities will not be able to fulfill Premier's estimated purchases as set out in the [***] of such Forecast. For the avoidance of doubt, the [***] are 2\n\nSource: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, 9/20/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nthe [***] immediately following the Forecast Delivery Date. If Heritage notifies Premier that it can fulfill Premier's Forecast for this [***] period, or if it fails to notify Premier that it cannot fulfill that portion of the Forecast, Heritage shall be obligated to fulfill, or cause Jasper to fulfill as applicable, if ordered through POs, the full amount of Product set forth for purchase during [***] (\"Firm Forecast\").\n\n(h) Within the [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Heritage shall provide to Premier a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth Heritage's good faith estimated maximum monthly unit volume (\"Maximum Volume\") for each Facility during such [***] period. Modifications to the Maximum Volume shall be negotiated in good faith and agreed upon by both Parties in writing or email by the [***] of the calendar month.\n\n(i) Premier shall provide Heritage with Purchase Orders (or \"POs\") [***] in advance of the date referred to as the \"Due Date\" in such POs. The POs, at a minimum, will give the Products and quantities ordered, the Due Date requested, and designate which Facility will manufacture the Products. \"Due Date\" shall mean the production start date requested by Premier.\n\n(j) Within [***] of receipt of a PO, Heritage shall (i) provide to Premier email confirmation of acceptance of the PO, a schedule of production and an estimated production completion date (the \"Estimated Completion Date\"), or (ii) notify Premier if any term of the PO cannot be met. Heritage's failure to notify Premier, within the time specified herein, of an inability to meet a term of the PO shall constitute acceptance of such PO in its entirety. If Heritage notifies Premier that it or Jasper cannot meet the Due Date, the Parties shall discuss an acceptable alternate date on which production will commence (the \"Production Date\"). Once a Due Date is accepted or a Production Date is mutually agreed upon, Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to start production on or before the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), but in no case more than [***] earlier or later than the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) unless mutually agreed otherwise by Premier.\n\n(k) If PREMIER requests that Products be produced at the Heritage Facility, Heritage may either produce such Products at the Heritage Facility or cause Jasper to produce such Products at the Jasper Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the Products to the Heritage Facility. If Premier requests that Products be produced at the Jasper Facility, Heritage may either cause Jasper to produce such Products at the Jasper Facility or produce such Products at the Heritage Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the Products to the Jasper Facility.\n\n(l) If a PO is accepted by Heritage as described in Section 2(j) above but such PO is not filled in accordance with its terms, or if Heritage or Jasper, as applicable, fails to complete production of the Products [***], Premier shall have the right to use an alternate co-packer for the Products specified in the PO and Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to, provide Premier with Premier owned packaging needed to support such production by an alternate co-packer.\n\n(m) Purchase Orders will be Premier's best estimate of its current requirements, but may be amended up or down or canceled in their entirety by Premier to reflect changing demand for Products. The final Unit quantities on Premier's Purchase Orders will count towards the MAOV. However, if (i) any increase or decrease in Unit volume under a particular PO is greater than [***] of the initial PO quantity and (ii) Premier requests such change or cancellation within the [***] period prior to the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) (the \"[***] Period\"), Heritage in its sole discretion, may charge Premier [***]. In no event shall Premier pay [***] if (i) it cancels or modifies any PO prior to the commencement of the [***] Period (i.e.; prior to the commencement of the [***] period preceding the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), (ii) Heritage or Jasper fails to timely start production in the [***] period before or after the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), or (iii) the basis for Premier's cancellation is a breach by Heritage of its obligations, representations or warranties hereunder. 3\n\nSource: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, 9/20/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(n) Heritage shall within [***] after the end of the production run, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***]. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.\n\n(o) Heritage represents and warrants that:\n\n(i) All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"), shall conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.

If Heritage wishes to redact any material from any EIR, it shall indicate that deletion by use of the following note where each redaction occurs: \"REDACTED MATERIAL\".
