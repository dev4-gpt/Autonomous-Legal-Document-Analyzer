Commerce One represents and warrants to         Corio that (a) Commerce One is the sole and exclusive owner of the         Software; (b) Commerce One has full and sufficient right, title and         authority to grant the rights and/or licenses granted to Corio under         this Agreement; (c) the Software does not contain any materials         developed by a third party used by Commerce One except pursuant to a         license agreement; and (d) the Software does not infringe any patent,         copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights         of a third party.\n\n7.3     Product Warranty. Commerce One warrants that the Software and         MarketSite.net Service will perform in substantial accordance with the         Documentation, and the media on which the Software is distributed will         be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, for         a period of sixty (60) days from the Effective Date, but in no event not         later than December 31, 1999 (the \"Warranty Period\"). In addition,         Commerce One warrants that during the Warranty Period the Software and         MarketSite.net Service is free of any willfully introduced computer         virus, or any other similar harmful, malicious or hidden program or         data, which is designed to disable, erase, or alter the Software, or any         other files, data, or software. If during the Warranty Period the         Software and MarketSite.net Service does not perform in substantial         compliance with the Documentation, Commerce One shall take all         commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software and         MarketSite.net Service, or if correction of the Software and         MarketSite.net Service is reasonably not possible, replace such Software         and MarketSite.net Service free of charge. Commerce One will replace any         defective media returned to Commerce One during the Warranty Period. In         the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably corrected at         Commerce One's sole expense, Corio has the right to terminate this         Agreement and receive a refund of all prepaid fees. The foregoing are         Corio's sole and exclusive remedies for breach of product warranty. The         warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Corio only.         The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.\n\n7.4     Product Warranty - Year 2000 Compliance. Commerce One warrants that the         Software and MarketSite.net Service, when used in accordance with its         associated documentation, is in all material respects capable upon         installation of accurately processing, providing and/or receiving date         data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,         including the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations; provided         that all licensee and third party equipment, systems, hardware, software         and firmware used in combination with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service properly exchange date data with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service\n\n                                     8\n\n9         OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF         MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8       INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1     By Commerce One. Commerce One shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless         Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Corio or its         Customers arising out of any claim that the Software infringes any         patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party;         provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies Commerce One in         writing of any such claim and promptly tenders the control and the         defense and settlement of any such claim to Commerce One at Commerce         One's expense and with Commerce One's choice of counsel. Corio or its         Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense,         in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join         in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the         Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject         of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that         the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and         expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to         use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other         suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software         becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after         Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid         hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9         REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n                                     9\n\n10         LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS         AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE         OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE         GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES         HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH         PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date         and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of         five (5) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for         subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other         party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the         expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal         thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2    Termination. If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the         termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7,         8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. Corio's right to allow its then-existing Customers         and their Software Users to use and access the Software in accordance         with Section 2 of this Agreement and all payment obligations related         thereto shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.         Commerce One's obligation to provide Software support and maintenance to         Corio and its Customers shall survive any termination or expiration of         this Agreement, provided Corio continues to make its annual support and         maintenance payments as specified in this Agreement. Upon termination or         expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise return or         destroy any Confidential Information of the other party provided,         however, Corio may retain any Confidential Information necessary for         Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers.\n\n12      SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1    Escrow Account. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce         One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce         One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW AGENT\"). The         Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n                                    10\n\n11         escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar         materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a         minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio         shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain         such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2         of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code         to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source         Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of         this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those         purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that         one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and         that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow         account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the         normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of         its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this         Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt         of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in         writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers         of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business         days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10)         business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the         matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in         Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to         Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,         nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use         and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until         the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License         Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified         shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use,         reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with         respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense         the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this         Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in         and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide         in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has         occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One         under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One operations personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].

Commerce One may, in its sole but         reasonable discretion, elect to assign resources from a third party         systems integrator subject to advance notification to Corio of such         election.\n\n13.3    Engineering. Commerce One shall provide Corio with reasonable access to         Commerce One engineering personnel at no additional cost to Corio. Joint         engineering work may include product development, including without         limitation, technical and functional application development and         integration.\n\n13.4    Other. All services provided hereunder, in addition to services         subsequently requested by Corio (e.g. customization of the Software)         shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the         parties.\n\n13.5    Ownership. Subject to Commerce One's pre-existing ownership of any         materials or technology provided to Corio, the results of all such         development efforts set forth in this Section 13, including all         intellectual property rights in any software interface coding or         programs created solely by Corio during the term of this Agreement to         enable the Software to operated within the Corio Servers' hosted         environment (\"DEVELOPMENTS\"), shall be owned by Corio, unless such         Developments are supported on an ongoing basis by Commerce One in which         case Commerce One will retain all ownership rights, including\n\n\n\n\n\n     intellectual property rights in the Developments. To the extent that         Commerce One would otherwise have a claim of ownership in such         Developments, Commerce One hereby assigns all rights in and to such         Developments to Corio. Further, Commerce One represents and warrants         that all Commerce One employees, agents, contractors or consultants that         will be provided to work together with Corio have or will have signed         agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions         and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Corio         covenants and warrants that it will not disclose to Commerce One or its         officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors or consultants any         proprietary information, including without limitation any technical         information related to Developments created solely by Corio under this         Agreement, except upon the written authorization to do so by a Corporate         Officer of Commerce One. Commerce One covenants that during the term of         this Agreement, it will continue to require all Commerce One employees,         agents, contractors or consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention         Agreement and that Commerce One will furnish to Corio copies of such         signed agreements upon Corio's request. Ownership of intellectual         property rights to any enhancements, modifications or derivative works         to the Software itself which may be developed jointly by the parties or         solely by Corio shall be negotiated by the parties prior to the start of         any such development work.\n\n13.6    Independent Development: Covenant not to Sue. Nothing in this Agreement         will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently         develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that         it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its         officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties'         licensees, customers, or distributors (\"Protected Entities\") for patent         infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to         said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that         Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the         Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work         based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is         binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the         benefit of any\n\n                                    12\n\n13         of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce         One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any         of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or         obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without         the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the         foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in         connection with the merger or acquisition of such party or the sale of         all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement without         such consent, except in the case where such transaction involves a         direct competitor of the other party where consent of the other party         will be required. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and         inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and         permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1         shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any         provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and         signed by the party to be charged. No failure or delay by either party         in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except         as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such         right, power or remedy.\n\n14.3    Choice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by         the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws         provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts         for the International Sale of Goods.

The arbitration shall be conducted by         one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San         Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered         in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without         limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing         party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American         Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for         the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of         its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices.

The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\n14.6    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of         competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be         changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n                                    13\n\n14         objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by         law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full         force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this         agreement for any failure or delay in performance caused by reasons         beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God,         earthquakes, strikes or shortages of materials.\n\n14.8    Subcontract. Commerce One understands and agrees that Corio shall solely         direct the provision of Corio Services and may subcontract certain         portions of the Corio Services to third parties at any time during the         term of the Agreement.\n\n14.9    Bankruptcy.
