Walter Thompson (\"FMM\") with offices at 300 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243 and iVillage, Inc., (\"iVillage\") with offices at 170 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10010. FMM and iVillage may be referred to generically as a \"Party\", or collectively as \"Parties\".\n\n         WHEREAS, iVillage operates a site on the World Wide Web and America Online (the \"Network\"), which contains channels including Parent Soup, ParentsPlace, Better Health and Armchair Millionaire as well as career, fitness & beauty, relationships, work from home, travel, money and food channels.\n\n         WHEREAS, FMM seeks to promote the sale of its automotive products across the Network.\n\n         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, iVillage and FMM hereby agree as follows:\n\n1.       Term and Termination.\n\n         A. Term. The initial production period shall be for a period of two (2) months to commence on November 4, 1998 (the \"Production Period\"), and the remaining term of this Agreement shall be for a period of twenty four (24) months to commence on the tentative launch date of January 4, 1999, unless terminated earlier as provided herein (the \"Promotion Period\"), (The Production Period and the Promotion Period shall be collectively referred to as the \"Initial Term\"). The Parties agree that prior to July 1, 2000, iVillage will provide FMM with the opportunity to renew this Agreement (the \"Renewal Term\") on terms set forth in a proposal (the \"Proposal) to be presented to FMM. FMM shall indicate its acceptance or rejection of the Proposal no later than August 31, 2000. If iVillage does not receive FMM's acceptance or rejection of the Proposal by August 31, 2000, iVillage may interpret FMM's non response as a rejection of the Proposal. The Proposal shall include maximum payment fees by FMM with respect to the Renewal Term.\n\n         B. Termination. In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice thereof. In addition, either Party may terminate this Agreement effective upon written notice stating its intention to terminate in the event the other Party (i) ceases to function as a going concern or to conduct operations in the normal course of business, or (ii) has a petition filed by or against it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency law which petition has not been dismissed or set aside within sixty (60) days of its filing. In addition to the foregoing, if on or after January 31, 2000, either Party determines, based upon reasonable and mutually agreed upon measurable standards, that (x) the other Party has materially underperformed its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or (y) the expectations of such Party have been materially unfulfilled, such Party may terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days written notice to the other Party. Additionally, in the event of a prolonged and/or substantial\n\nstrike which materially and adversely affects Ford's ability to produce and sell cars, the Parties will work together in good faith to amend or terminate this Agreement.\n\n2.       Promotion.\n\n         A. During the Production Period, iVillage will design, develop, construct and host a Ford bridge site (the \"Bridge Site\") which shall include approximately [*] pages of content and other interactive material such as a travel planner or a car design feature. During the Promotion Period, iVillage will continue to host, maintain and update the Bridge Site. Upon receipt from iVillage of the proposed Bridge Site design and content, FMM shall have no more than five (5) business days in which to provide iVillage with its acceptance or rejection of the design and content. If iVillage does not receive FMM's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem FMM's silence as acceptance. The Parties shall work together to determine the content mix and delivery deadlines in order to maximize the effectiveness of the sponsorship campaign.\n\n         B. During the Initial Term, iVillage will design, create and deliver [*] Ford-branded advertising units. The advertising units shall be subject to FMM's final approval. iVillage will deliver approximately [*] new advertising units each during the Promotion Period. For purposes of this Agreement, an advertising unit can include but shall not be limited to banners in the form of rich media, java-based, animated, daughter and/or pull-down banners, or a combination of appropriate technologies, and which shall represent and be defined by industry standards.\n\n         C.\n\n                  (i) During the Promotion Period, iVillage will deliver a\n\n\n\n\n\n         minimum of [*] advertising impressions, in an equal proportion each          month. Subject to reasonable written notice to iVillage, FMM may          request a reasonable reallocation of impressions as determined by FMM.          The advertising units of Ford Division and other Ford Motor Company          entities shall be served by a third party advertisement server, which          shall be compliant with Net gravity, or Doubleclick or other compatible          technology.\n\n                  (ii) During the Promotion Period, iVillage traffic shall be          audited by a third party traffic auditor listed on Exhibit A and          iVillage shall provide FMM with relevant reports on a biweekly basis.          iVillage will provide ongoing marketing, creative, technical and          editorial consultation to FMM.\n\n                  (iii) In the event that iVillage fails to deliver the          advertising impressions during the Promotion Period, FMM shall have the          option of either (a) extending the Initial Term of this Agreement for          an additional three (3) month period to \"make good\" the undelivered          impressions or (b) requiring iVillage to refund to FMM an amount equal          to [*] for each [*] impressions which were not delivered.\n\n                  (iv) However, if iVillage falls to deliver the advertising          impressions during the Promotion Period and FMM desires that iVillage          \"make good\" the undelivered impressions and extend the Initial Term          pursuant to option (a) set forth in Section 2.C.(iii), if the Parties          have decided not to renew the Initial Term and iVillage desires to          enter into an agreement with an entity whose business(es) would pose a          conflict to FMM                                         2\n\n         or Ford Motor Credit, then iVillage, at iVillage's option, may refund          the remaining impression deficiency to FMM, and immediately upon          pavement of such, the \"make good\" obligation shall terminate.\n\n         D. During the Initial Term, iVillage will design and administer, (i) a minimum of [*] online conferences which shall include live chats and the archiving of conference transcripts (dates of such conferences shall be determined by FMM and shall occur approximately once every two months, but not earlier than March 1, 1999 and FMM shall provide iVillage with not less than forty five (45) days advance notice of any conference); (ii) a minimum of [*] online polls; (iii) a minimum of [*] sixty-second surveys; (iv) a minimum of [*] online focus groups; and (v) a minimum of [*] customized turn-key Network sweepstakes (iVillage shall be responsible for all aspects of the sweepstakes other than the prize(s) which shall be provided by Ford Motor Company (\"FMC\")). FMM and FMC's respective advertising agencies shall be free to provide input with respect to the aforementioned promotional efforts set forth in this section and shall have the opportunity to reasonably approve such efforts.\n\n         E. During the Initial Term, iVillage will develop and administer [*] message boards pertaining to topics mutually determined by the Parties. The first message board shall be live on or about January 4, 1999, or in conjunction with the launch of the Bridge Site.\n\n         F. During the Promotional Period, iVillage will place special Ford-branded text links, newsletter mentions, hotlinks and taglines throughout the Network. FMC shall have prior approval over all iVillage uses of any, Ford Mark, as defined below. In the event that any of the Ford-branded links and/or mentions set forth in this Section 2.F. are, in FMC's reasonable judgment, materially injurious to FMC. FMC shall provide written notice of such offense to iVillage. iVillage shall then have one (1) business day in which to cure said offense.\n\n3.       Reporting. During the Promotion Period, iVillage agrees to provide FMM with biweekly reports in connection with the promotional obligations set forth in this Agreement in addition to semi-annual executive reviews with iVillage management. All traffic reports shall be audited by the third party traffic auditor selected pursuant to Section 2.C.(ii). iVillage shall also provide, on a timely basis, impression tracking reports from a third party tracking system, confirming guaranteed impression delivery.\n\n4.

In addition, in the event that iVillage desires to form a sponsorship relationship with an automobile rental company during the term of this Agreement, iVillage shall notify Hertz and provide Hertz with an opportunity to enter into such a relationship with iVillage, on not less favorable terms than those offered to any other automobile rental company. Once presented with an opportunity, Hertz shall have five (5) business days in which to accept or reject such terms. If iVillage does not receive Hertz's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem Hertz's silence as rejection. The terms of any such relationship shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FMC shall, on a non-exclusive basis,\n\n                                       3\n\nbe permitted to offer Ford Motor Credit car financing products related to the purchase of Ford vehicles.\n\n5.       Fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n         A. FMC agrees to pay iVillage, upon signing of this Agreement, an upfront, non-refundable, non-recoupable production and set up fee in the amount of [*].
