  "clauses": {
    "Termination": "The Termination clause is extracted from the contract as follows:\n\n**11. TERMINATION**\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party, which has not been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof.\n\nIn the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason, all obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder shall cease, except that the parties agree to remain jointly and severally liable for any breach of the Confidential Agreement Dated January 4, 1999.\n\nAll rights and remedies provided herein will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law or otherwise.",
    "Indemnity": "The *Indemnity* clause from this contract is:\n\n\"INDEMNITY.\n\nEach party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\") against any loss, damage, claim or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (i) any breach of this Agreement by such party; (ii) any negligence or willful misconduct by such party in performing its obligations under this Agreement; or (iii) the unauthorized use of the other party's Confidential Information. The indemnifying party shall promptly notify the Indemnitees of any claim or demand that may give rise to a duty to indemnify, and the Indemnitees shall cooperate with the indemnifying party at such party's expense in the defense and settlement of such claim. In no event shall an Indemnitee be entitled to settle any claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party.\"\n\nThis clause is found under Section 12 of the contract, titled \"GENERAL PROVISIONS\".",

Confidential Information**\n\n(a) The parties agree to hold confidential and not disclose or use for their own purposes any confidential information disclosed by the other party in connection with this Agreement.\n\n(b) \"Confidential Information\" means all information, whether written, oral, or electronic, that is disclosed by one party to the other party in connection with this Agreement, and which is not publicly available knowledge.\n\n(c) The parties agree to use reasonable care to prevent unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and to limit access to such information to employees who have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.\n\n(d) This Section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years after the date of termination or expiration."
  },
  "risks": {
    "Termination": "I would rate this Termination clause as **Medium risk**. This is because it provides a clear process for terminating the agreement in case of a material breach, but also retains liability for non-compliance with confidentiality obligations beyond the termination date, which could lead to unforeseen consequences or disputes.",
    "Indemnity": "I would rate this *Indemnity* clause as Medium risk.\n\nRationale: This clause requires each party to indemnify the other against various types of losses or claims, which could result in significant financial exposure. While it does contain some limitations, such as requiring prompt notice and cooperation from the indemnifying party, the potential liabilities are substantial enough to warrant a medium-risk rating.",
    "Confidentiality": "I would rate the *Confidentiality* clause as **Medium risk** because while it sets out clear obligations to maintain confidentiality, it does not include any specific provisions for handling sensitive information (e.g. encryption), nor does it address potential exceptions or waivers, which could leave room for misinterpretation or unintentional breaches of confidentiality."
