  "doc_id": "ADAPTIMMUNETHERAPEUTICSPLC_04_06_2017-EX-10.11-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT.txt",
  "contract_type": "I would classify this contract as a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (MOU) or an \"Agreement in Principle\" rather than one of the specific types you mentioned (NDA, SLA, MSA).\n\nThe document appears to be a non-binding agreement outlining the terms and objectives of a collaboration between MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adaptimmune. The language used is informal and does not contain the typical provisions found in a legally binding contract. The text is more akin to a press release or a joint statement announcing the partnership, rather than a formal agreement.\n\nThe MOU likely outlines the parties' intentions to collaborate on cancer research, clinical trials, and potentially future commercialization of therapies, but it does not appear to be a binding contract that sets forth specific obligations, responsibilities, or liabilities.",
  "clauses": {
    "Termination": "The termination clause from this contract is not explicitly stated. However, it can be implied that the contract may terminate under certain circumstances, such as:\n\n* Upon expiration of the term specified in the contract (not explicitly stated)\n* By mutual agreement of the parties\n* In the event of a material breach by one party that is not cured within a reasonable time period\n* Due to insolvency or bankruptcy of one party\n\nThe forward-looking statements section at the end of the document may also contain language related to termination, such as:\n\n\"We do not undertake any obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Adaptimmune reserves the right to modify or terminate these forward-looking statements at any time.\"\n\nHowever, this is not a formal termination clause and should be interpreted in conjunction with the overall context of the contract.",
    "Indemnity": "There is no *Indemnity* clause extracted from the provided contract. The text does not contain a specific clause with that name.",
    "Confidentiality": "There is no *Confidentiality* clause in this contract. The contract appears to be a press release announcing a partnership between MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adaptimmune, a biopharmaceutical company, for the development of new cancer immunotherapy products. It does not contain any confidentiality agreements or clauses."
  },
  "risks": {
    "Termination": "I would rate the Termination clause as Medium risk.\n\nThe reason for this rating is that while there are some implied termination scenarios mentioned, there is no explicit termination clause stated. Additionally, the forward-looking statements section contains some language related to modification or termination, but it's not a formal clause and should be interpreted in conjunction with the overall context of the contract, which may lead to ambiguity and potential disputes if a termination scenario arises.",
    "Indemnity": "Since there is no Indemnity clause present in the provided contract, I would rate the risk as Low because the absence of such a clause reduces the likelihood of unforeseen liabilities or financial burdens arising from the agreement.",
    "Confidentiality": "I would rate this *Confidentiality* clause as **Low** risk because there is no mention of confidential information being shared or disclosed, and the contract appears to be a public announcement of a partnership between two organizations, suggesting that sensitive information is not being shared."
  },
  "summary": "Here is a summary of the contract in 2-3 sentences:\n\nThe contract is an exhibit to a larger agreement between Adaptimmune, a biopharmaceutical company, and MD Anderson Cancer Center. The agreement aims to develop multiple new first-generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against various solid tumors, with the goal of augmenting patients' immune systems to attack cancer cells. The partnership will generate valuable data from patient samples to help understand these therapies and design next-generation studies."
