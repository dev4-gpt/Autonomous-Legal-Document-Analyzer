  "contract_type": "Based on the content of the contract, I would classify it as a Master Service Agreement (MSA).\n\nAn MSA is a long-term agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for a vendor to provide services to a customer over an extended period. This contract appears to be an MSA because:\n\n1. It establishes the general responsibilities of the parties involved.\n2. It outlines the roles and expectations of each party in detail (e.g., Collectible Concepts Group's responsibilities for marketing, sales, and fulfillment).\n3. It includes provisions for termination, liquidation, and dispute resolution.\n\nIn contrast to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), which focuses on confidentiality and intellectual property protection, this contract does not have any specific provisions related to confidentiality or trade secrets. Additionally, it is not an SLA (Service Level Agreement) because it does not specifically define service levels or performance metrics.\n\nOverall, the structure and content of this contract suggest that it is a Master Service Agreement (MSA).",
  "clauses": {
    "Termination": "The Termination clause is extracted from this contract:\n\n**11. Procedure on Termination and Liquidation.**\n\nOn any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.",
    "Indemnity": "The *Indemnity* clause is found in Section 11: Procedure on Termination and Liquidation.\n\nHere's the relevant text:\n\n\"On any termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set forth in Section 6.\"\n\nThis clause appears to provide for the distribution of assets upon termination of the joint venture, including payment of any debts and distribution of remaining funds and assets.",
    "Confidentiality": "The *Confidentiality* clause is not explicitly stated in this contract. However, it's possible that some aspects of confidentiality are implied or mentioned in other clauses.\n\nFor example, Clause 11 mentions that on termination of the Joint Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to the Joint Venturers. This could imply a level of confidentiality regarding financial information and transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 16 refers to \"Exhibit A: General Responsibilities of the Parties.\" If Exhibit A contains specific responsibilities related to confidentiality, it would not be explicitly stated here but might be mentioned elsewhere in the contract or in separate agreements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements).\n\nTo confirm whether a Confidentiality clause exists, I recommend reviewing the entire contract and any accompanying exhibits or agreements."

  "risks": {
    "Termination": "I would rate this Termination clause as **Medium** risk. The justification is that while the clause provides a clear procedure for distributing joint venture assets in the event of termination, it also leaves some room for negotiation and potential disputes between the parties regarding the value and distribution of indivisible assets, which could lead to complications or even litigation.",
    "Indemnity": "I would rate the *Indemnity* clause as Low risk with this justification:\n\nThe clause appears to be a standard provision for winding up a joint venture's affairs, ensuring that all debts are paid and any remaining funds or assets are distributed fairly among the joint venturers. This type of clause is common in many business agreements and does not introduce significant new risks or uncertainties.",
    "Confidentiality": "I would rate the *Confidentiality* clause as Medium risk. The justification is that while there may be implicit references to confidentiality in other clauses, it's not explicitly stated, which could lead to potential misunderstandings or gaps in confidentiality protection."
  },
  "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of this contract:\n\nThe contract outlines the terms and conditions for a joint venture between Collectible Concepts Group, Inc. (CCGI) and Pivotal Self Service Tech, Inc. (PVSS). The parties will work together to market and sell products, with CCGI responsible for obtaining licenses, preparing artwork, and engaging in sales activities, while PVSS will provide the products themselves and negotiate favorable pricing with suppliers. Upon termination of the joint venture, any remaining assets will be distributed equally between the two parties."
